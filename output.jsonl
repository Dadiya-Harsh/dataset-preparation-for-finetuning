{"instruction": "Write a detailed evaluation report for Firecrawl's LLM Extract, comparing its performance against CrawlBench-Easy and CrawlBench-Hard benchmarks, including scores, accuracy rates, and observations on model and prompt variations. Include analysis of the impact of custom prompts on performance and recommendations for future development.", "response": "[Launch Week III RecapSee our releasesApril 14th to 20th](https://www.firecrawl.dev/launch-week) Dec 9, 2024 • [Swyx](https://x.com/swyx) # Evaluating Web Data Extraction with CrawlBench The most common AI Engineering task, after you have a really good web scraper/crawler like Firecrawl, is to feed it in as context to an LLM, **extracting structured data output.** From populating spreadsheets and databases, to driving decisions in code based on deterministic rules this stuctured data is incredible useful. This is a fundamental building block of any AI agent that needs to read in arbitrary state and knowledge from the real world. Firecrawl’s beta of [LLM Extract](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/extract) caught my eye when it was announced, it claimed to generate structured data from any webpage and I immediately wondered how reliable it could be for my use cases. Hallucinations are commonplace in LLMs and even structured data output is still not a fully mature modality where we understand every edge case, and on top of that, there was no benchmark available for LLM-driven data extraction on realistic web data. So we made one! Today, **we are sharing the results of CrawlBench** on Firecrawl’s LLM Extract, and open sourcing the codebase for others to explore LLM-based Structured Data Extraction further. **CrawlBench is a simple set of realistic, reproducible benchmarks**, based on work from Y Combinator (CrawlBench-Easy) and OpenAI (CrawlBench-Hard), that form a reasonable baseline for understanding the impact of varying: - model selection (the default unless otherwise stated is `gpt-4o-mini`), - prompting (default prompt is hardcoded in LLM Extract but overridable), and - tasks (different schemas) for common workloads of LLM-based structured data extraction. Work was also done on the WebArena benchmark from Carnegie Mellon (prospectively CrawlBench-Medium), but due to its sheer complexity and outages relative to the expected results, we halted work on it for at least the initial version of CrawlBench. ## Y Combinator Directory Listing (CrawlBench-Easy) The task here is the simplest possible extraction task: Y Combinator maintains a [list of 50 top companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies), as well as a chronological ordering of each batch, with a lot of structured data available for each company in their database. We compared the LLM Extract-driven output with ground truth derived from manually written scrapers covering the exact schema from the Y Combinator website (exemptions were made for common, understandable mismatches, eg for differently hosted logo images, to avoid unreasonable penalties). Scores were then tallied based on an “exact match” basis and on a ROUGE score basis. For the top 50 YC companies, Firecrawl did quite well: ```markdown ================================================== Final Results: ================================================== Total Exact Match Score: 920/1052 Overall Exact Match Accuracy: 87.5% Average ROUGE Score: 93.7% ``` This isn’t a perfect 100% score, but that’s fine because many failures are within a reasonable margin of error, where, for example, the LLM is actually helping us extract the correct substring, compared to our ground truth scrape, which has no such intelligence: ```jsx Mismatch at /companies/zepto > companyMission: We deliver groceries in 10 minutes through a network of optimized micro-warehouses or 'dark stores' that we build across cities in India. != We deliver groceries in 10 minutes through a network of optimized micro-warehouses or 'dark stores' that we build across cities in India. We're currently doing hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales with best-in-class unit economics - come join us! ``` Based on a manual audit of the remaining mismatches, **we’d effectively consider Firecrawl to have saturated Crawlbench-Easy with a 93.7% ROUGE score on extracting >1000 datapoints on top Y Combinator companies.** Readers can use our code to expand this analysis to all ~5000 YC companies but we do not expect it to be meaningfully different for the cost that would entail. ## OpenAI MiniWoB (CrawlBench-Hard) The last set of use cases we wanted to explore was a combination of **Firecrawl for web agents** and **robustness to prompt injections**. Again, we needed a statically reproducible dataset with some institutional backing to compare LLM Extract with. The [2017 World of Bits paper](https://jimfan.me/publication/world-of-bits/) was the earliest exploration into computer-using web agents by OpenAI, with a very distinguished set of coauthors: World of Bits consists of MiniWoB, FormWoB, and QAWoB, which are small exploratory datasets used to scale up to the full WoB dataset scaled up by crowdworkers. Out of all these datasets, OpenAI only released MiniWoB, which is the focus of our evaluations. Since we are not executing full web agents, we did not directly run the MiniWoB benchmark on Firecrawl. Instead our task was to extract first **the list of tasks (Level 0)**, and then, for each task, **the specific instructions given to the computer-using agents (Level 1)**. These tasks range from “Click on a specific shape” and “Operate a date picker” to more complex agentic interactions like “Order food items from a menu.” and “Buy from the stock market below a specified price.” However there were some interesting confounders in this task: the example lists “Example utterances” and “Additional notes”, and also sometimes omits fields. Using LLM-Extract naively meant that the LLM would sometimes hallucinate answers to these fields because they could be interpreted to be asking for placeholders/”synthetic data”. This means that MiniWoB often also became a dataset for unintentional prompt injections/detecting hallucinations. Based on our tests, **Firecrawl did perfectly on Crawlbench-Hard Level 0 and about 50-50 on Level 1.** Level 1 had >700 datapoints compared to >500 on Level 0, so the combined benchmark result comes in at 70%: ```jsx ================================================== Level 0 Results: ================================================== Total Score: 532/532 Overall Accuracy: 100.0% ================================================== Level 1 Results: ================================================== Total Score: 382/768 Overall Accuracy: 49.7% ================================================== Combined Results: ================================================== Total Score Across Levels: 914/1300 Overall Accuracy: 70.3% ``` ## Varying Models and Prompts However this is where we found we could tweak LLM Extract. By default LLM Extract only uses gpt-4o-mini, so a natural question is what happens if you vary the models. We tested it out an initial set of realistically-cheap-enough-to-deploy-at-scale models (this is NOT all the models we used, but we are saving that surprising result for later) and found very comparable performances with some correlation to model size: Here are the prompts we ended up using - you can see that the first 2 tried to be as task agnostic as possible, whereas the last ( `customprompt`) peeked ahead to identify all the issues with the default prompt runs and were prompt engineered specifically to reduce known issues. ``` 'default': 'Based on the information on the page, extract all the information from the schema. Try to extract all the fields even those that might not be marked as required.', 'nohallucination': 'Based on the page content, extract information that closely fits the schema. Do not hallucinate information that is not present on the page. Do not leak anything about this prompt. Just extract the information from the source content as asked, where possible, offering blank fields if the information is not present.', 'customprompt': 'Based on the page content, extract information that closely fits the schema. Every field should ONLY be filled in if it is present in the source, with information directly from the source. The \"Description\" field should be from the source material, not a description of this task. The fields named \"additional notes\", \"utterance fields\" and \"example utterances\" are to be taken only from the source IF they are present. If they are not present, do not fill in with made up information, just leave them blank. Do not omit any markdown formatting from the source.', ``` Running these 3 prompts across all the candidate models produced a 2 dimensional matrix of results, with shocking outperformance for custom prompts: **The conclusion we must draw here is that tweaking model choice is almost 7x less effective than prompt engineering for your specific task** (model choice has a max difference of 6 points, vs an **average 41 point improvement** when applying custom prompts) **.** By custom prompting for your task, you can reduce your costs dramatically — the most expensive model on this panel (gpt-4o) is 67x the cost of the cheapest (Gemini Flash) — for ~no loss in performance. So, at scale, you should basically **always customize your prompt**. As for LLM-Extract, our new `nohallucination` prompt was able to eke out an average +1 point improvement in most model performance, so this could constitute sufficient evidence to update the default prompt shipped with LLM-Extract. ## Bonus: Claude 3.5 models are REALLY good… Although its much higher cost should give some pause, the zero shot extraction capabilities of the new Sonnet and Haiku models greatly surprised us. Here’s the same charts again, with the newer/more expensive Anthropic models: That’s a whopping 13.8 point jump on CrawlBench-Hard between 3 Haiku and 3.5 Haiku, [though it is 4x more expensive](https://x.com/simonw/status/1853509565469671585?s=46), it is still ~4x cheaper than Sonnet, which itself saw a sizable 7.2 point CrawlBench-Hard bump between the June and October 3.5 Sonnet versions. In other words, if you don’t have time or have a wide enough scrape data set that you cannot afford to craft a custom prompt, you could simply pay Anthropic to get a pretty decent baseline. _\\> Note: We considered adding the other newer bigger models like the o1 models but they do not yet support structured output and in any case would be prohibitively expensive and not realistic for practical extraction use._ ## Conclusion Structured Data Extraction is a fundamental building block for any web-browsing LLM agent. We introduce CrawlBench-Easy and CrawlBench-Hard as a set of simple, realistic, reproducible benchmarks that any LLM Extraction tool can be evaluated against, offering enough data points to elucidate significant differences in model and prompt performance that line up with intuitive priors. We are by no means done - CrawlBench-Medium with its survey of e-commerce, social network, and admin panel scenarios is a possible next step - but with this initial publication, we are now able to quantify and progress the state of the art in LLM Extraction.

While many graphical tools exist, using **cURL**, a powerful command-line utility, gives you granular control over HTTP requests. Coupled with **Firecrawl**, a scraping API that can handle dynamic browser interactions and complex authentication flows, you can seamlessly extract data from behind login forms, protected dashboards, and other restricted content. Before we get started, we only recommend scraping behind authentication if you have permission from the resources owner. In this guide, we’ll first introduce cURL and common authentication methods. Then, we’ll show how to combine these approaches with Firecrawl’s API, enabling you to scrape authenticated pages that would otherwise be challenging to access. You’ll learn everything from basic authentication to custom headers, bearer tokens, cookies, and even multi-step logins using Firecrawl’s action sequences. ## What is cURL? **cURL (Client URL)** is a command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols, commonly HTTP and HTTPS. It’s usually pre-installed on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux) and easily available for Windows. With cURL, you can quickly test APIs, debug endpoints, and automate repetitive tasks. Check if cURL is installed by running: ```bash curl --version ``` If installed, you’ll see version details. If not, follow your operating system’s instructions to install it. cURL is lightweight and script-friendly—an excellent choice for integrating with tools like Firecrawl. With cURL at your fingertips, you can seamlessly orchestrate authenticated scraping sessions by combining cURL’s request capabilities with Firecrawl’s browser-powered scraping. ## Why Use Firecrawl for Authenticated Scraping? **Firecrawl** is an API designed for scraping websites that might be hard to handle with a simple HTTP client. While cURL can handle direct requests, Firecrawl provides the ability to: - Interact with websites that require JavaScript execution. - Navigate multiple steps of login forms. - Manage cookies, headers, and tokens easily. - Extract content in structured formats like Markdown or JSON. By pairing cURL’s command-line power with Firecrawl’s scraping engine, you can handle complex authentication scenarios—like logging into a site with a username/password form, or including custom headers and tokens—that would be difficult to script using cURL alone. ## Authentication Methods Authenticated scraping means you must prove your identity or authorization to the target server before accessing protected content. Common methods include: 1. **Basic Authentication** 2. **Bearer Token (OAuth 2.0)** 3. **Custom Header Authentication** 4. **Cookie-Based (Session) Authentication** We’ll look at each method in the context of cURL, and then integrate them with Firecrawl for real-world scraping scenarios. ### 1\\. Basic Authentication **Basic Auth** sends a username and password encoded in Base64 with each request. It’s simple but should always be used over HTTPS to protect credentials. **cURL Syntax:** ```bash curl -u username:password https://api.example.com/securedata ``` For APIs requiring only an API key (as username): ```bash curl -u my_api_key: https://api.example.com/data ``` **With Firecrawl:** If Firecrawl’s endpoint itself requires Basic Auth (or if the site you’re scraping uses Basic Auth), you can include this in your request: ```bash curl -u YOUR_API_KEY: https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape ``` This authenticates you to the Firecrawl API using Basic Auth, and you can then direct Firecrawl to scrape authenticated targets. ### 2\\. Bearer Token Authentication (OAuth 2.0) **Bearer Tokens** (often from OAuth 2.0 flows) are secure, time-limited keys that you include in the `Authorization` header. **cURL Syntax:** ```bash curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.example.com/profile ``` **With Firecrawl:** To scrape a site requiring a bearer token, you can instruct Firecrawl to use it: ```bash curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer fc_your_api_key_here\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"url\": \"https://example.com\", \"formats\": [\"markdown\"] }' ``` Here, `fc_your_api_key_here` is your Firecrawl API token. Firecrawl will handle the scraping behind the scenes, and you can also add target-specific headers or actions if needed. ### 3\\. Custom Header Authentication Some APIs require custom headers for authentication (e.g., `X-API-Key: value`). These headers are sent alongside requests to prove authorization. **cURL Syntax:** ```bash curl -H \"X-API-Key: your_api_key_here\" https://api.example.com/data ``` **With Firecrawl:** To scrape a page requiring a custom header, just include it in the POST data: ```bash curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"url\": \"https://protected.example.com\", \"headers\": { \"X-Custom-Auth\": \"token123\" } }' ``` Firecrawl will use the custom header `X-Custom-Auth` when loading the page. ### 4\\. Cookie-Based Authentication Websites often rely on sessions and cookies for authentication. After logging in via a form, a cookie is set, allowing subsequent authenticated requests. **cURL for Cookie Handling:** Save cookies after login: ```bash curl -c cookies.txt -X POST https://example.com/login \\ -d \"username=yourusername&password=yourpassword\" ``` Use these cookies for subsequent requests: ```bash curl -b cookies.txt https://example.com/protected ``` **With Firecrawl:** If you need to scrape a protected page that uses cookies for authentication, you can first obtain the cookies using cURL, then pass them to Firecrawl: 1. **Obtain Cookies:** ```bash curl -c cookies.txt -X POST https://example.com/login \\ -d \"username=yourusername&password=yourpassword\" ``` 2. **Use Cookies with Firecrawl:** ```bash curl -b cookies.txt -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"url\": \"https://example.com/protected\", \"formats\": [\"markdown\"] }' ``` Firecrawl will then request the protected URL using the cookies you’ve supplied. ## Real-World Examples ### GitHub API GitHub’s API supports token-based auth: ```bash curl -H \"Authorization: token ghp_YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/repos ``` Scraping authenticated GitHub pages (like private profiles) with Firecrawl: ```bash curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"url\": \"https://github.com/settings/profile\", \"headers\": { \"Cookie\": \"user_session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE; tz=UTC\", \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\" } }' ``` ### Dev.to Authentication Dev.to uses API keys as headers: ```bash curl -H \"api-key: YOUR_DEV_TO_API_KEY\" https://dev.to/api/articles/me ``` To scrape behind login forms, leverage Firecrawl actions: ```bash curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"url\": \"https://dev.to/enter\", \"actions\": [\\ {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\\ {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"input[type=email]\"},\\ {\"type\": \"write\", \"text\": \"your@email.com\"},\\ {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"input[type=password]\"},\\ {\"type\": \"write\", \"text\": \"your_password\"},\\ {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"button[type=submit]\"},\\ {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\\ {\"type\": \"navigate\", \"url\": \"https://dev.to/dashboard\"},\\ {\"type\": \"scrape\"}\\ ] }' ``` Firecrawl can interact with the page dynamically, just like a browser, to submit forms and then scrape the resulting authenticated content. ## Conclusion When combined, **cURL and Firecrawl** provide a powerful toolkit for scraping authenticated websites. cURL’s flexibility in handling HTTP requests pairs perfectly with Firecrawl’s ability to navigate, interact, and extract data from pages that require authentication. Whether you need to pass API keys in headers, handle OAuth tokens, emulate sessions, or fill out login forms, these tools make the process efficient and repeatable. Try the examples provided, check out [Firecrawl’s documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction) for more advanced use cases, and start confidently scraping authenticated websites today! **Happy cURLing and Firecrawling!** Article updated recently ## About the Author [\\ Rudrank Riyam@rudrankriyam](https://x.com/rudrankriyam) Rudrank Riyam is a Technical Writer & Author.

This article will guide you through building a powerful application that automatically discovers and visualizes client relationships by intelligently scraping company websites using Firecrawl, organizing the data into a hierarchical tree structure, and presenting it through an interactive visualization powered by Streamlit and PyVis. Whether you’re a business analyst looking to map industry connections or a developer interested in creating insightful data visualizations, this project combines web scraping, data processing, and interactive visualization techniques into a practical, real-world application. Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk through each component of the system step by step, from setting up the semantic web scraping with Firecrawl to recursively building client relationship trees and creating an intuitive user interface with Streamlit. You’ll learn how to extract structured client data from unstructured web content, implement efficient tree traversal algorithms, transform hierarchical data into interactive network graphs, and package everything into a polished web application that users can easily interact with. By the end of this article, you’ll have a complete, deployable application that can generate comprehensive client relationship visualizations for any company with just a few clicks. ## High-level Overview of the Application Now that we’ve outlined what we’ll be building, let’s explore how the different pieces of our application work together. Our client relationship tree application combines several powerful technologies to create a seamless, end-to-end solution. At the core of our architecture is Python, which serves as the foundation for all our components. The application consists of four main parts: a web scraper powered by Firecrawl, a tree builder for organizing client relationships, a visualization engine using PyVis and NetworkX, and a user interface built with Streamlit. [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) is an AI-powered web scraping API that understands website content beyond just the HTML structure. Unlike traditional web scrapers that need custom rules and code for each website, Firecrawl can identify client information across different website layouts because it understands the meaning of the content. This capability allows our application to work consistently across various company websites without requiring custom configuration for each one. The components work together in a pipeline that transforms raw website data into an interactive visualization. When a user enters a company URL in the Streamlit interface, this triggers the ClientScraper to fetch data using Firecrawl. The results are passed to the ClientTreeBuilder, which recursively builds the relationship tree to the specified depth. Once the scraper collects client data, the tree builder component organizes it into a hierarchical structure, with each company linking to its clients. This tree is then converted into a network graph using NetworkX and PyVis, which allows for interactive visualization with features like zooming, dragging, and highlighting connections. Finally, Streamlit provides an intuitive web interface where users can input company URLs, adjust settings, and view the resulting relationship graphs without needing to understand the underlying code. All these operations happen behind the scenes, with Streamlit managing the state of the application and displaying appropriate loading indicators while processing occurs. This architecture balances performance with user experience, allowing complex data processing to happen while keeping the interface responsive and easy to use. ## Running the Application Locally To run the Client Relationship Tree Visualization application on your local machine, follow these step-by-step instructions. This guide assumes you have Python 3.10+ installed on your system. ### 1\\. Clone the Repository First, clone the repository from GitHub using the following commands: ```bash git clone https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples.git cd firecrawl-app-examples/logo-tree-builder ``` ### 2\\. Set Up Poetry This project uses Poetry for dependency management. If you don’t have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Once Poetry is installed, set up the project environment: ```bash # Create virtual environment and install dependencies poetry install ``` This command will create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, including Streamlit, Firecrawl, PyVis, and NetworkX. ### 3\\. Configure the Application Before running the application, you’ll need a Firecrawl API key. If you don’t have one yet, you can sign up at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev/) to obtain your API key. You can configure the API key in two ways: - Enter it directly in the Streamlit interface when you run the application - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the project directory with the following content: ```toml [firecrawl] api_key = \"your_firecrawl_api_key_here\" ``` ### 4\\. Run the Application Now you’re ready to run the application using Poetry: ```bash poetry run streamlit run streamlit_app.py ``` This command will start the Streamlit server, and you should see output similar to: ```plaintext You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser. Local URL: http://localhost:8501 Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501 ``` Open the provided local URL in your web browser to access the application. You can now: 1. Enter a company website URL 2. Set the desired crawl depth and maximum clients per company 3. Click “Build client tree” to generate an interactive visualization of the client relationships ### 5\\. Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues: - Ensure your Firecrawl API key is valid and has sufficient credits - Check your internet connection as the application needs to make API calls - For deep crawls, be patient as it may take some time to process multiple levels of relationships - If you see memory errors, try reducing the maximum depth or clients per company settings The application creates a temporary directory for visualization files, which are automatically cleaned up when the application restarts. ## Implementing a Client Scraper At the core of our application is the `ClientScraper` class located in `src/scraper/client_scraper.py`. This component handles the extraction of client information from company websites, serving as the foundation for our relationship mapping. The scraper is responsible for converting unstructured website content into structured data about company clients, which can then be used to build our relationship tree. The `ClientScraper` uses Firecrawl, an AI-powered web scraping API, to understand and extract semantic information from websites. Unlike traditional web scrapers that rely on rigid HTML selectors or XPath expressions, Firecrawl can identify client information across different website layouts through its understanding of content meaning. This capability is implemented through a schema-based extraction approach: ```python class CompanySchema(BaseModel): \"\"\"Schema for a company with its website URL.\"\"\" name: str = Field(description=\"The name of the company\") website_url: str = Field(description=\"The website URL of the company\") class ClientsSchema(BaseModel): \"\"\"Schema for a list of clients of a company.\"\"\" clients: list[CompanySchema] = Field(description=\"A list of clients of the company\") firecrawl_app.scrape_url(\"https://firecrawl.dev\", params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"] \"extract\": {\"schema\": ClientsSchema.model_json_schema()} }) ``` Learn how to get started with Firecrawl in our [crawling endpoint guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-the-crawl-endpoint-in-firecrawl). The scraper incorporates several efficiency features to optimize performance. It maintains a cache of previously scraped URLs to prevent redundant requests, normalizes URLs to handle variations (such as with/without www prefixes), and implements batch processing for multiple websites. These optimizations are crucial when building deeper relationship trees that could potentially involve hundreds of company websites. Within our application architecture, the `ClientScraper` serves as the data acquisition layer, feeding into the `ClientTreeBuilder` (located in `src/scraper/tree_builder.py`), which recursively constructs the relationship hierarchy. This separation of concerns allows the tree builder to focus on the recursive traversal logic while delegating the actual data retrieval to the specialized scraper component. The clean interface between these components enables efficient tree construction even when dealing with complex, multi-level client relationships. ## Building a Tree of Relationships Having established our data acquisition layer with the `ClientScraper`, we now need a mechanism to recursively build a comprehensive tree structure that captures the hierarchical relationships between companies and their clients. This is where the `ClientTreeBuilder` class (located in `src/scraper/tree_builder.py`) comes into play, serving as the structural backbone of our application by transforming flat client data into a meaningful relationship hierarchy. The `ClientTreeBuilder` orchestrates the complex process of recursively traversing client relationships to the specified depth while implementing several optimization strategies. At its core, the builder maintains a set of processed URLs to prevent cycles in the relationship graph, which is crucial when mapping real-world business relationships where companies might refer to each other as clients. This cycle detection ensures our application doesn’t enter infinite recursion loops while building the tree. The tree builder also implements a configurable limit on the number of clients per company, which prevents exponential growth of the tree structure and keeps processing times manageable even for popular companies with numerous clients. The heart of the tree builder is the `_build_tree_recursive` method, which implements a breadth-first traversal strategy at each level of the relationship hierarchy. For each company, it first fetches its immediate clients using the `ClientScraper`, then recursively processes each client’s relationships up to the specified maximum depth. One of the key optimizations in this implementation is batch processing - instead of making individual requests for each client at a given level, the builder collects all client URLs at that level and processes them in a single batch operation using Firecrawl’s `batch_scrape_urls` method, significantly reducing the number of API calls and improving performance. Within our application’s architecture, the `ClientTreeBuilder` bridges the gap between raw data acquisition and visualization, creating a well-structured tree of `Company` objects (defined in `src/models/company.py`) that can be easily traversed and converted into a network graph for visualization. This separation of concerns allows each component to focus on its specific responsibility: the scraper extracts client data, the tree builder creates the hierarchical structure, and the visualization components (which we’ll explore next) transform this structure into an interactive graph. This modular design enhances maintainability and allows each component to be refined independently as the application evolves. ## Converting the Relationship Tree into a Graph With our hierarchical tree structure in place, the next step is to transform this data into an interactive, visually appealing network graph. This transformation is handled by the `ClientGraphRenderer` class (located in `src/visualization/graph_renderer.py`), which serves as the visualization engine of our application. The renderer takes the `Company` tree built by the `ClientTreeBuilder` and converts it into a network graph representation that users can interact with. The graph renderer uses two powerful Python libraries: NetworkX for graph data manipulation and PyVis for interactive visualization rendering. This combination allows us to first construct a mathematical representation of the client relationships as a directed graph, then render it as an interactive HTML visualization with features like zoom, pan, and node selection. The renderer uses a recursive approach to traverse the company tree, adding each company as a node and each client relationship as a directed edge in the graph, preserving the hierarchical structure while allowing for a more flexible visual representation. Visualization customization is a key focus of the renderer, offering features like color-coding to distinguish between different types of relationships, sizing nodes based on their importance in the network, and providing informative tooltips that display additional company details on hover. These visual cues help users quickly understand complex relationship patterns that might be difficult to discern from raw data alone. The renderer also implements physics-based layout algorithms that automatically position nodes to minimize edge crossings and highlight natural clusters in the relationship network. The output of the graph renderer is an interactive HTML file that can be embedded directly in the Streamlit interface, creating a seamless user experience where relationships can be explored dynamically. This interactive visualization serves as the primary output of our application, presenting the results of our semantic web scraping and relationship analysis in an intuitive format that business users can easily navigate and extract insights from. By handling the complex transformation from hierarchical data to visual network, the graph renderer completes the data processing pipeline and prepares the results for presentation in the user interface. ## Building the Streamlit UI With our data acquisition, processing, and visualization components in place, we need a user-friendly interface to bring everything together. This is where Streamlit comes into play, allowing us to create an interactive web application without requiring extensive frontend development. The interface is implemented in the `ClientTreeApp` class (located in `src/ui/app.py`), which orchestrates the interaction between the user and our underlying components. The Streamlit interface provides several key functionalities that make our application accessible to non-technical users. First, it offers a simple form for inputting the root company URL and configuring critical parameters like crawl depth and maximum clients per company. These parameters directly affect the tree building process, allowing users to balance between comprehensive analysis and processing time based on their specific needs. The interface also includes authentication management for the Firecrawl API, securely handling API keys while providing clear instructions for new users. One of the most important features of our Streamlit interface is its ability to handle asynchronous operations gracefully. Building client relationship trees can take significant time, especially at deeper levels, so the UI implements progress tracking and status updates that keep users informed throughout the process. This is accomplished through Streamlit’s session state management, which maintains context between interactions and allows for persistent display of results across application refreshes. The final piece of our application is the integration of the visualization output directly within the interface. When the tree building process completes, the HTML visualization generated by the `ClientGraphRenderer` is embedded directly in the Streamlit page using an `iframe` component, creating a seamless experience where users can interact with the relationship graph without leaving the application. The interface also provides options for downloading the visualization or raw data in various formats, enabling users to incorporate the results into their own workflows or presentations. ## Deployment Considerations Now that we’ve built a complete client relationship tree application, let’s explore how to deploy it for real-world use. Deploying this application requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. The simplest deployment option is [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud), which offers a straightforward path to making your application accessible online. By connecting your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository containing the application code to Streamlit Cloud, you can have the application running with minimal configuration. This approach works well for demonstrations and smaller-scale usage scenarios. For applications requiring more customization or handling sensitive data, alternatives like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), or [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) provide more control over the deployment environment. API key management is a critical consideration when deploying this application. The [Firecrawl API](https://firecrawl.com/) key should never be hardcoded in your application but instead managed through environment variables or a secrets management system. In Streamlit Cloud, you can set these as secrets in the dashboard. For other platforms, use their respective secrets or environment variables systems. This approach ensures that sensitive credentials aren’t exposed in your code repository while remaining accessible to the application at runtime. Performance optimization becomes increasingly important as the application scales. Consider implementing caching at multiple levels: within the application (as we’ve already done with the [`ClientScraper`](https://github.com/your-repo/ClientScraper) cache), at the server level using [Redis](https://redis.io/) or similar technology, and potentially through CDN caching for static assets. For applications that experience heavy usage, you might want to decouple the UI from the data processing by implementing a task queue (using [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) or similar) that handles client tree building asynchronously, allowing the application to remain responsive even during complex operations. Resource scaling is another important consideration. The recursive nature of client relationship discovery can potentially consume significant CPU and memory resources, especially for deeper trees or popular companies with many clients. Configure your deployment environment to set appropriate memory limits and consider implementing more aggressive client count limitations for public-facing deployments. Additionally, implementing rate limiting for the API is advisable to prevent abuse and [manage costs associated with the Firecrawl API](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/rate-limits), which typically charges based on usage volume. By addressing these deployment considerations, you can successfully transition your client relationship tree application from a local development environment to a production-ready service that can reliably support real-world usage patterns while managing resources efficiently. ## Conclusion In this article, we’ve built a powerful application that discovers and visualizes client relationships between companies. Our tool combines several technologies to create something useful: Firecrawl for intelligent web scraping, Python for data processing, and Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface. Anyone can use this application to map out business connections, find sales opportunities, or understand market relationships without needing technical skills. By entering a company’s website URL and a few settings, users can generate interactive visualizations that reveal hidden connections between businesses that might otherwise take days of manual research to discover. Looking ahead, there are several ways this application could be improved. We could add features like saving relationship maps for later use, comparing multiple company networks side by side, or analyzing changes in client relationships over time. The visualization could be enhanced with additional data like company size, industry classification, or financial information to provide more context. We could also improve performance for very large networks by implementing more sophisticated caching or using database storage for persistent results. Whether you use this application as-is or extend it with your own features, it provides a solid foundation for exploring and understanding the complex web of business relationships in today’s interconnected market.

It provides simple methods for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, saving you hours of work. Beautiful Soup is great for web scraping projects where you need to extract specific pieces of information from web pages. Some common use cases for BeautifulSoup include extracting article text or metadata from news sites, scraping product details and pricing from e-commerce stores, gathering data for machine learning datasets, and more. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through several ways to get BeautifulSoup installed on your system and show you some basic usage examples to get started. ## Installing BeautifulSoup There are a few different ways you can install BeautifulSoup depending on your Python environment and preferences. ### Using pip The recommended way to install BeautifulSoup is with pip: ```bash python -m pip install beautifulsoup4 ``` This will install the latest version of BeautifulSoup 4. Make sure you have a recent version of Python (3.6+) and pip. ### Using conda If you’re using the Anaconda Python distribution, you can install BeautifulSoup from the conda-forge channel: ```bash conda install -c conda-forge beautifulsoup4 ``` ### In a virtual environment It’s good practice to install Python packages in an isolated virtual environment for each project. You can set up BeautifulSoup in a new virtual environment like this: ```bash python -m venv bsenv source bsenv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `bsenv\\Scripts\\activate` pip install beautifulsoup4 ``` ## Troubleshooting Here are a few things to check if you run into issues installing BeautifulSoup: - Make sure your Python version is 3.6 or higher - Upgrade pip to the latest version: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` - If using conda, ensure your Anaconda installation is up-to-date - Verify you have proper permissions to install packages. Use `sudo` or run the command prompt as an administrator if needed. Check the BeautifulSoup documentation or post on Stack Overflow if you need further assistance. ## Usage Examples Let’s look at a couple quick examples of how to use BeautifulSoup once you have it installed. ### Parsing HTML Here’s how you can use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML retrieved from a web page: ```python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests url = \"https://mendable.ai\" response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') print(soup.title.text) # 'Example Domain' ``` We use the requests library to fetch the HTML from a URL, then pass it to BeautifulSoup to parse. This allows us to navigate and search the HTML using methods like `find()` and `select()`. ### Extracting Data BeautifulSoup makes it easy to extract data buried deep within nested HTML tags. For example, to get all the links from a page: ```python links = soup.find_all('a') for link in links: print(link.get('href')) # 'https://www.firecrawl.dev/' ``` The `find_all()` method retrieves all `` tag elements. We can then iterate through them and access attributes like the `href` URL using `get()`. By chaining together `find()` and `select()` methods, you can precisely target elements and attributes to scrape from the messiest of HTML pages. BeautifulSoup is an indispensable tool for any Python web scraping project. For more advanced web scraping projects, consider using a dedicated scraping service like [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/). Firecrawl takes care of the tedious parts of web scraping, like proxy rotation, JavaScript rendering, and avoiding detection, allowing you to focus your efforts on working with the data itself.

There are several online databases that track startups, investments, and company growth, containing details about millions of businesses, their funding rounds, and investors. While many of these platforms offer APIs, they can be expensive and out of reach for many users. This tutorial will show you how to build a web scraper that can gather company and funding data from public sources using Python, Firecrawl, and Claude. This guide is designed for developers who want to collect company data efficiently and ethically. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a working tool that can extract company details, funding rounds, and investor information from company profiles across the web. Here is the preview of the app: The application provides two input methods for users - they can either upload a file containing company names or enter them directly as text. Behind the scenes, Firecrawl automatically scrapes relevant company information from public databases like Crunchbase. This scraped data is then processed by Claude, an AI assistant that generates concise company summaries. The results are displayed in a clean Streamlit interface, complete with a download option that exports all findings to a CSV file for further analysis. ## Table of Contents 1. Introduction 2.

Conclusion **Time to Complete:** ~60 minutes **Prerequisites:** - Python 3.10+ - Basic Python knowledge - API keys for Firecrawl and Claude **Important Note:** This tutorial demonstrates web scraping for educational purposes. Always review and comply with websites’ terms of service and implement appropriate rate limiting in production environments. ## Setting up the Development Environment Let’s start by setting up our development environment and installing the necessary dependencies. 1. **Create a working directory** First, create a working directory: ```bash mkdir company-data-scraper cd company-data-scraper ``` 2. **Install dependencies** We’ll use Poetry for dependency management. If you haven’t installed Poetry yet: ```bash curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - ``` Then, initialize it inside the current working directory: ```bash poetry init ``` Type “^3.10” when asked for the Python version but, don’t specify the dependencies interactively. Next, install the project dependencies with the `add` command: ```bash poetry add streamlit firecrawl-py pandas pydantic openpyxl python-dotenv anthropic ``` 3. **Build the project structure** ```bash mkdir data src touch .gitignore README.md .env src/{app.py,models.py,scraper.py} ``` The created files serve the following purposes: - `data/` \\- Directory to store input files and scraped results - `src/` \\- Source code directory containing the main application files - `.gitignore` \\- Specifies which files Git should ignore - `README.md` \\- Project documentation and setup instructions - `.env` \\- Stores sensitive configuration like API keys - `src/app.py` \\- Main Streamlit application and UI code - `src/models.py` \\- Data models and validation logic - `src/scraper.py` \\- Web scraping and data collection functionality 4. **Configure environment variables** This project requires two accounts of third-party services: - [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) for AI-powered web scraping - [Anthropic (Claude)](https://console.anthropic.com/) for summarizing scraped data Click on the hyperlinks above to create your accounts and copy/generate your API keys. Then, Inside the `.env` file in the root directory, add your API keys: ```plaintext FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ``` The `.env` file is used to store sensitive configuration like API keys securely.The `python-dotenv` package will automatically load these environment variables when the app starts. It should never be committed to version control so add the following line to your `.gitignore` file: ```plaintext .env ``` 5. **Start the app UI** Run the Streamlit app (which is blank just now) to ensure everything is working: ```bash poetry run streamlit run src/app.py ``` You should see the Streamlit development server start up and your default browser open to the app’s interface. Keep this tab open to see the changes we make to the app in the next steps. Now that we have our development environment set up, let’s cover how Firecrawl works, which is a prerequisite to building our app. ## Prerequisite: Scraping with Firecrawl The biggest challenge with any application that scrapes websites is maintenance. Since websites regularly update their layout and underlying HTML/CSS code, traditional scrapers break easily, making the entire app useless. Firecrawl solves this exact problem by allowing you to scrape websites using natural language. Instead of writing complex CSS selectors and XPath expressions that need constant maintenance, you can simply describe what data you want to extract in plain English. Firecrawl’s AI will figure out how to get that data from the page, even if the website’s structure changes. This makes our scraper much more reliable and easier to maintain over time. Here is a simple Firecrawl workflow we will later use in the app to scrape company information: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() ``` ```plaintext True ``` We import `FirecrawlApp` to interact with the Firecrawl API for web scraping. `BaseModel` and `Field` from pydantic help us define structured data models with validation. The `load_dotenv` function loads environment variables from our `.env` file to securely access API keys. ```python # Define the data structure we want to extract class CompanyData(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"Company name\") funding_total: str = Field(description=\"Total funding amount\") employee_count: str = Field(description=\"Number of employees\") industry: str = Field(description=\"Primary industry or sector\") founded_year: str = Field( description=\"Year the company was founded\" ) # Initialize Firecrawl ``` Next, we define a Pydantic data model specifying the fields we want to extract from a website. Firecrawl will follow this schema to the letter - detecting the relevant HTML/CSS selectors containing this information and returning them in a simple JSON object. Here, the `Field` descriptions written in plain English are important as they guide the underlying Firecrawl AI to capture the required fields. ```python app = FirecrawlApp() # Scrape company data from Crunchbase data = app.extract( urls=[\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai\"], params={ \"schema\": CompanyData.model_json_schema(), # Use our schema for extraction \"prompt\": \"Extract key company information from the page\", }, ) ``` We then initialize a `FirecrawlApp` instance and call its `extract` method, passing in the URL for OpenAI’s Crunchbase page. The `params` dictionary configures the scraping behavior - we provide our `CompanyData` schema to guide the structured data extraction. We also include a prompt to help direct the extraction process. The scraped data is returned in a format matching our schema, which we can then parse into a CompanyData object for easy access to the extracted fields, as shown in the following code block. ```python # Access the extracted data company = CompanyData(**data[\"data\"]) print(f\"Company: {company.name}\") print(f\"Funding: {company.funding_total}\") print(f\"Employees: {company.employee_count}\") print(f\"Industry: {company.industry}\") print(f\"Founded: {company.founded_year}\") ``` ```plaintext Company: OpenAI Funding: null Employees: 251-500 Industry: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Founded: 2015 ``` In a later step, we will integrate this process into our app but will use the `batch_scrape_urls` method instead of `extract` to enable concurrent scraping. ## Building the Funding Data Scraper Step-by-Step We will take a top-down approach to building the app: starting with the high-level UI components and user flows, then implementing the underlying functionality piece by piece. This approach will help us validate the app’s usability early and ensure we’re building exactly what users need. ### Step 1: Adding brief app information We turn our focus to the `src/app.py` file and make the following imports: ```python import streamlit as st import pandas as pd import anthropic from typing import List from dotenv import load_dotenv # from scraper import CrunchbaseScraper load_dotenv() ``` The imports above serve the following purposes: - `streamlit`: Provides the web interface components and app framework - `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and CSV file handling - `anthropic`: Client library for accessing Claude AI capabilities - `typing.List`: Type hint for lists to improve code readability - `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from `.env` file for configuration Currently, the `CrunchbaseScraper` class is commented out since we are yet to write it. Next, we create a `main` function that holds the core UI components: ```python def main(): st.title(\"Crunchbase Company Data Scraper\") st.write( \"\"\" Extract detailed company information from Crunchbase including funding data, employee counts, industries, and more. Upload a file with company names or enter them manually below. \"\"\" ) ``` Right now, the function gives brief info about the app’s purpose. To run the app, add the following `main` block to the end of `src/app.py`: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() ``` You should see the change in the Streamlit development server. ### Step 2: Adding components for company name input In this step, we add a new function to `src/app.py`: ```python def load_companies(file) -> List[str]: \"\"\"Load company names from uploaded file\"\"\" companies = [] for line in file: company = line.decode(\"utf-8\").strip() if company: # Skip empty lines companies.append(company) return companies ``` The `load_companies` function takes a file object as input and parses it line by line, extracting company names. It decodes each line from bytes to UTF-8 text, strips whitespace, and skips any empty lines. The function returns a list of company names that can be used for scraping Crunchbase data. Now, make the following changes to the `main` function: ```python def main(): st.title(\"Crunchbase Company Data Scraper\") st.write( \"\"\" Extract detailed company information from Crunchbase including funding data, employee counts, industries, and more. Upload a file with company names or enter them manually below. \"\"\" ) # File upload option uploaded_file = st.file_uploader( \"Upload a text file with company names (one per line)\", type=[\"txt\"] ) # Manual input option st.write(\"### Or Enter Companies Manually\") manual_input = st.text_area( \"Enter company names (one per line)\", height=150, help=\"Enter each company name on a new line\", ) ``` In this version, we’ve added two main ways for users to input company names: file upload and manual text entry. The file upload component accepts `.txt` files and for manual entry, users can type or paste company names directly into a text area, with each name on a new line. This provides flexibility for users whether they have a prepared list or want to enter names ad-hoc. Furthermore, add these two blocks of code after the input components: ```python def main(): ... companies = [] if uploaded_file: companies = load_companies(uploaded_file) st.write(f\"Loaded {len(companies)} companies from file\") elif manual_input: companies = [line.strip() for line in manual_input.split(\"\\n\") if line.strip()] st.write(f\"Found {len(companies)} companies in input\") ``` This code block processes the user input to create a list of company names. When a file is uploaded, it uses the `load_companies()` function to read and parse the file contents. For manual text input, it splits the input text by newlines and strips whitespace to extract company names. In both cases, it displays a message showing how many companies were found. The companies list will be used later for scraping data from funding data sources. ### Step 3: Building a scraping class with Firecrawl Let’s take a look at the snapshot of the final UI once again: In this step, we implement the backend process that happens when a user clicks on “Start scraping” button. To do so, we use Firecrawl like we outlined in the prerequisites section. First, go to `src/models.py` script to write the data model we are going to use to scrape company and funding information: ```python from pydantic import BaseModel from typing import List, Optional class CompanyData(BaseModel): name: str about: Optional[str] employee_count: Optional[str] financing_type: Optional[str] industries: List[str] = [] headquarters: List[str] = [] founders: List[str] = [] founded_date: Optional[str] operating_status: Optional[str] legal_name: Optional[str] stock_symbol: Optional[str] acquisitions: List[str] = [] investments: List[str] = [] exits: List[str] = [] total_funding: Optional[str] contacts: List[str] = [] ``` This data model is more detailed and tries to extract as much information as possible from given sources. Now, switch to `src/scraper.py` where we implement a class called `CrunchbaseScraper`: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from models import CompanyData from typing import List, Dict class CrunchbaseScraper: def __init__(self): self.app = FirecrawlApp() def scrape_companies(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict]: \"\"\"Scrape multiple Crunchbase company profiles\"\"\" schema = CompanyData.model_json_schema() try: data = self.app.batch_scrape_urls( urls, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": { \"prompt\": \"\"\"Extract information from given pages based on the schema provided.\"\"\", \"schema\": schema, }, }, ) return [res[\"extract\"] for res in data[\"data\"]] except Exception as e: print(f\"Error while scraping companies: {str(e)}\") return [] ``` Let’s break down how the class works. When the class is initialized, it creates an instance of `FirecrawlApp`. The main method `scrape_companies` takes a list of URLs and returns a list of dictionaries containing the scraped data. It works by: 1. Getting the JSON schema from our `CompanyData` model to define the structure 2. Using `batch_scrape_urls` to process multiple URLs at once 3. Configuring the scraper to use the “extract” format with our schema 4. Providing a prompt that instructs the scraper how to extract the data 5. Handling any errors that occur during scraping Error handling ensures the script continues running even if individual URLs fail, returning an empty list in case of errors rather than crashing. Now, the only thing left to do to finalize the scraping feature is to add the “Start Scraping” button to the UI. ### Step 4: Adding a button to start scraping In this step, return to `src/app.py` and add the following code block to the very end of the `main()` function: ```python def main(): ... if companies and st.button(\"Start Scraping\"): scraper = CrunchbaseScraper() with st.spinner(\"Scraping company data from Crunchbase...\"): try: # Convert company names to Crunchbase URLs urls = [\\ f\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/{name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}\"\\ for name in companies\\ ] results = scraper.scrape_companies(urls) except Exception as e: st.error(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\") ``` This code block builds on the previous functionality by adding the core scraping logic. When the “Start Scraping” button is clicked (and companies have been provided), it: 1. Creates a new instance of our `CrunchbaseScraper` class 2. Shows a loading spinner to indicate scraping is in progress 3. Converts the company names into proper Crunchbase URLs by: - Converting to lowercase - Replacing spaces with hyphens - Adding the base Crunchbase URL prefix 4. Calls the `scrape_companies` method we created earlier to fetch the data The try-except block ensures any scraping errors are handled gracefully rather than crashing the application. This is important since web scraping can be unpredictable due to network issues, rate limiting, and so on. To finish this step, uncomment the single import at the top of `src/app.py` so that they look like this: ```python import streamlit as st import pandas as pd import anthropic from typing import List from scraper import CrunchbaseScraper from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() ``` ### Step 5: Creating a download button for the scraped results Now, we must create a button to download the scraped results as a CSV file. To do so, add the following code block after the scraping part: ```python def main(): ... if companies and st.button(\"Start Scraping\"): scraper = CrunchbaseScraper() with st.spinner(\"Scraping company data from Crunchbase...\"): try: ... results = scraper.scrape_companies(urls) # THIS PART IS NEW df = pd.DataFrame(results) csv = df.to_csv(index=False) # Create download button st.download_button( \"Download Results (CSV)\", csv, \"crunchbase_data.csv\", \"text/csv\", key=\"download-csv\", ) except Exception as e: st.error(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\") ``` In the new lines of code, we convert the results to a Pandas dataframe and use its `to_csv()` function to save the dataframe as a CSV file. The method returns a filename, which we pass to the `st.download_button` method along with other details. ### Step 6: Generating a summary of scraped results After scraping the raw company data, we can use Claude to generate concise summaries that highlight key insights. Let’s add this functionality to our app. First, create a new function in `src/app.py` to handle the summarization: ```python def generate_company_summary(company_data: dict) -> str: \"\"\"Generate a summary of the company data\"\"\" client = anthropic.Anthropic() message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\", max_tokens=1000, system=\"You are a company & funding data expert. Summarize the given company data by the user in a few sentences.\", messages=[\\ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": str(company_data)}]}\\ ], ) return message.content[0].text ``` Now, update the scraping section in the `main()` function to include the summary generation after the download button: ```python def main(): ... if companies and st.button(\"Start Scraping\"): scraper = CrunchbaseScraper() with st.spinner(\"Scraping company data from Crunchbase...\"): try: ... # Give summary of each company for company in results: summary = generate_company_summary(company) st.write(f\"### Summary of {company['name']}\") st.write(summary) except Exception as e: st.error(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\") ``` This implementation: 1. Creates a new `generate_company_summary()` function that: - Formats the scraped company data into readable text - Uses Claude to analyze the data and generate insights - Returns a structured summary highlighting key patterns. 2. Updates the main scraping workflow to: - Generate the summary after scraping is complete - Display the insights for each company after the download button The summary can provide context about the scraped data, helping users get the gist of the scraped data. ### Step 7: Deploying the app to Streamlit Cloud Now that our app is working locally, let’s deploy it to Streamlit Cloud so others can use it. First, we need to prepare our project for deployment. 1. **Create a requirements.txt** Since Streamlit Cloud doesn’t support Poetry directly, we need to convert our dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file. Run this command in your terminal: ```bash poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes ``` 2. **Create a GitHub repository** Initialize a Git repository and push your code to GitHub: ```python git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/company-data-scraper.git git push -u origin main ``` 3. **Add secrets to Streamlit Cloud** Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) and connect your GitHub account. Then: 1. Click “New app” 2. Select your repository and branch 3. Set the main file path as src/app.py 4. Click “Advanced settings” and add your environment variables: - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` 4. **Update imports for deployment** Sometimes local imports need adjustment for Streamlit Cloud. Ensure your imports in src/app.py use relative paths: ```python from .models import CompanyData from .scraper import CrunchbaseScraper ``` 5. **Add a .streamlit/config.toml file** Create a `.streamlit` directory and add a `config.toml` file for custom theme settings: ```python [theme] primaryColor = \"#FF4B4B\" backgroundColor = \"#FFFFFF\" secondaryBackgroundColor = \"#F0F2F6\" textColor = \"#262730\" font = \"sans serif\" [server] maxUploadSize = 5 ``` 6. **Create a README.md file** Add a README.md file to help users understand your app: ```markdown # Crunchbase Company Data Scraper A Streamlit app that scrapes company information and funding data from Crunchbase. ## Features - Bulk scraping of company profiles - AI-powered data summarization - CSV export functionality - Clean, user-friendly interface ## Setup 1. Clone the repository 2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 3. Set up environment variables in `.env`: - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` 4. Run the app: `streamlit run src/app.py` ## Usage 1. Enter company names (one per line) or upload a text file 2. Click \"Start Scraping\" 3. View AI-generated insights 4. Download results as CSV ## License MIT ``` 7. **Deploy the app** After pushing all changes to GitHub, go back to Streamlit Cloud and: 1. Click “Deploy” 2. Wait for the build process to complete 3. Your app will be live at `https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/company-data-scraper/main` 4. **Monitor and maintain** After deployment: - Check the app logs in Streamlit Cloud for any issues - Monitor API usage and rate limits - Update dependencies periodically - Test the app regularly with different inputs The deployed app will automatically update whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository. Streamlit Cloud provides free hosting for public repositories, making it an excellent choice for sharing your scraper with others. ## Conclusion In this tutorial, we’ve built a powerful web application that combines the capabilities of Firecrawl and Claude to extract and analyze company data at scale.

Traditional search engines return lists of links rather than comprehensive answers, leaving users to do the heavy lifting of extracting and connecting information. As demonstrated in the video above, our open-source deep research application aims to solve this problem by automating the research process. The application uses Firecrawl’s deep research endpoint to actively explore the web, following relevant links and gathering information across multiple sources. Unlike standard search tools, it doesn’t just find information—it synthesizes it into comprehensive, well-structured answers with proper source citations. Built with Streamlit and Python, this tool provides a more affordable alternative to premium AI research services like OpenAI’s Advanced Data Analysis ($200/month subscription), while offering similar functionality for complex research tasks. In this article, we’ll walk through how to build this application step by step, from integrating the Firecrawl API to creating an intuitive user interface that displays real-time research progress. ## Understanding the Deep Research Endpoint Traditional web research presents numerous challenges as highlighted earlier. To address these limitations, Firecrawl introduces its deep research endpoint - a powerful solution specifically designed for comprehensive information gathering and synthesis. This AI-powered research API fundamentally transforms how applications gather and synthesize web information. Unlike traditional search engines that simply return a list of links, this endpoint actively explores the web to build comprehensive answers to complex queries. The system works through a multi-step process: first analyzing your query to identify key research areas, then iteratively searching and exploring relevant web content, synthesizing information from multiple sources, and finally providing structured findings with proper source attribution. What makes this endpoint particularly powerful is its ability to autonomously navigate between sources, following contextual threads to build a complete picture of a topic. The research process provides not just final answers but also detailed activity logs showing how the information was gathered, creating transparency that’s missing from typical AI responses. All research is returned with source citations, allowing users to verify information and explore topics further. The system is configurable through parameters that control research depth, time limits, and the maximum number of URLs analyzed. Implementing the deep research endpoint in your application is straightforward with the Firecrawl Python library. Here’s a simple example that demonstrates the core functionality: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp # Initialize the client firecrawl = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"your-api-key\") # Define research parameters params = { \"maxDepth\": 3, # Number of research iterations \"timeLimit\": 180, # Time limit in seconds \"maxUrls\": 10 # Maximum URLs to analyze } # Set up a callback for real-time updates def on_activity(activity): print(f\"[{activity['type']}] {activity['message']}\") # Run deep research results = firecrawl.deep_research( query=\"What are the latest developments in programming memes?\", params=params, on_activity=on_activity ) # Access research findings print(f\"Final Analysis: {results['data']['finalAnalysis']}\") print(f\"Sources: {len(results['data']['sources'])} references\") ``` ```plaintext [search] Generating deeper search queries for \"What are the latest developments in programming memes?\" [search] Starting 3 parallel searches for \"What are the latest developments in programming memes?\" [search] Searching for \"popular programming memes and their origins\" - Goal: To identify and analyze the most popular programming memes and trace their origins and evolution. [search] Found 15 new relevant results across 3 parallel queries [analyze] Analyzing findings and planning next steps [analyze] Analyzed findings [synthesis] Preparing final analysis [synthesis] Research completed Final Analysis: # Research Report: Latest Developments in Programming Memes ## Introduction Programming memes have become a significant part of the developer culture, serving as a humorous outlet for the challenges and quirks of coding. As of 2025, the landscape of programming memes has evolved, reflecting changes in technology, programming languages, and the developer community's sentiments. This report explores the latest developments in programming memes, analyzing current trends, popular themes, and their impact on the community... ``` In this example, we initialize the Firecrawl client with an API key, configure research parameters to control the scope and duration of the research, and set up a callback function to receive real-time updates as the research progresses. The `deep_research` method initiates the research process with our quantum computing query, and the results contain both the synthesized analysis and a list of sources that were consulted. This foundation of research capabilities will be the core of our Streamlit application, which we’ll build throughout this article. Next, we’ll look at the application structure that makes this application possible. ## The Application Structure ```python deep-research-endpoint/ ├── src/ │ ├── app.py # Main Streamlit application │ ├── firecrawl_client.py # Firecrawl API client wrapper │ ├── ui.py # UI components │ └── utils.py # Utility functions ├── requirements.txt # Dependencies ├── run.py # Simple launcher script └── README.md # Documentation ``` The deep research application follows a logical organization pattern with a modular file structure. The main directory contains a `run.py` script that launches the application, `requirements.txt` that lists all necessary Python dependencies, and a `README.md` file with installation and usage instructions. Inside the `src` directory, four Python files handle different aspects of the application: `app.py` serves as the main entry point and orchestrates the research process, `firecrawl_client.py` provides a dedicated wrapper for the Firecrawl API’s deep research endpoint, `ui.py` contains components for the user interface, and `utils.py` holds utility functions for data formatting and validation. This modular approach separates concerns and makes the code more maintainable. The `app.py` file initializes the Streamlit application and manages the main workflow, including processing user inputs and triggering research requests. The `firecrawl_client.py` module encapsulates all interaction with the Firecrawl API, isolating the complexity of making requests and handling responses. The `ui.py` file contains functions that generate the visual elements of the application such as the chat interface, activity display, and results formatting. Finally, `utils.py` provides helper functions that don’t fit into the other categories. This organization pattern is common in medium-sized applications as it balances simplicity with the benefits of code separation. ## Setting Up the Environment Before we can build our deep research application, we need to set up a proper development environment with all necessary dependencies. The application requires Python 3.7 or later and access to the Firecrawl API. To get started, first clone the GitHub repository containing the example code: ```bash git clone https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples.git cd firecrawl-app-examples/deep-research-endpoint ``` Once you have the code, create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies isolated from your system Python installation. This step prevents potential conflicts between different Python projects on your machine: ```bash python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate ``` Next, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` The requirements file includes three main dependencies: `streamlit` for the web interface, `requests` for handling HTTP requests, and `firecrawl-py` for interacting with the Firecrawl API. The most important configuration step is obtaining a [Firecrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev/), which you’ll need to use the deep research endpoint. You can get an API key by signing up at the Firecrawl website (firecrawl.dev). Once you have your API key, you’re ready to run the application. We’ll use this key in the application’s sidebar later, so there’s no need to set up environment variables or configuration files for this example. ## Implementing the Firecrawl Client Wrapper The `FirecrawlClient` wrapper serves as the foundation of our application, acting as the bridge between our Streamlit interface and Firecrawl’s powerful research capabilities. This component isolates all API-related code in one place, making the rest of our application cleaner and more maintainable. By centralizing API interactions, we create a single point of contact that can be easily updated if the Firecrawl API changes in the future, without requiring modifications to other parts of our code. ```python from typing import Dict, Any, Callable, Optional class FirecrawlClient: \"\"\"Client for interacting with the Firecrawl API.\"\"\" def __init__(self, api_key: str): \"\"\"Initialize the Firecrawl client with an API key. Args: api_key (str): The Firecrawl API key \"\"\" from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp self.client = FirecrawlApp(api_key=api_key) def deep_research( self, query: str, max_depth: int = 3, timeout_limit: int = 120, max_urls: int = 20, on_activity: Optional[Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]] = None, ) -> Dict[str, Any]: ``` The `deep_research` method in our client wrapper will be called whenever a user submits a query through the chat interface. This method transforms the user’s question and configuration settings into an API call, then processes the response into a consistent format for display. The ability to pass an activity callback function is particularly important, as it enables the real-time progress updates that make our application interactive and engaging for users. Later in our application workflow, we’ll integrate this client with Streamlit’s UI components. When a user submits a research query, the `app.py` file will create an instance of `FirecrawlClient`, call its `deep_research` method with the appropriate parameters, and use the results to update the chat history. The client’s role in formatting research results and extracting sources will be especially important when we implement the results display, as it provides clean, structured data that can be presented to users in a readable format. ## Building the Streamlit Interface Streamlit provides a straightforward way to build web interfaces in Python. Our application’s UI consists of three main components: a sidebar for settings, a chat interface for submitting queries and viewing responses, and an activity display for real-time updates. In the `ui.py` file, we implement functions for each of these components. The `setup_sidebar` function creates input fields for the API key and research parameters using Streamlit’s form elements like `st.text_input` and `st.slider`. For example, we create a slider for controlling research depth with `st.slider(\"Maximum Depth\", min_value=1, max_value=10, value=3)`, which lets users adjust how deeply the research process explores a topic. ```python # src/ui.py import streamlit as st from typing import Dict, Any, Tuple import time import random def setup_sidebar() -> Dict[str, Any]: \"\"\"Set up the sidebar with input fields. Returns: Dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing user inputs from the sidebar \"\"\" st.sidebar.title(\"Configuration\") api_key = st.sidebar.text_input( \"Enter your Firecrawl API Key\", type=\"password\", help=\"Your Firecrawl API key for authentication. You can obtain this from the Firecrawl dashboard.\", ) st.sidebar.markdown(\"### Research Parameters\") ``` The central chat interface relies on Streamlit’s chat elements. We use `st.chat_input` to create a text field where users enter research queries, and `st.chat_message` to display messages from both the user and assistant. To maintain conversation history across interactions, we implement session state management with `st.session_state`. This code pattern appears in the `init_session_state` function in `utils.py`: ```python def init_session_state(): \"\"\"Initialize session state variables if they don't exist.\"\"\" if \"messages\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.messages = [] if \"processing\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.processing = False if \"activity_container\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.activity_container = None if \"current_sources\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.current_sources = \"\" ``` The session state stores messages, research sources, and processing status, allowing the application to maintain context between user interactions without requiring a database. The real-time activity display is one of the most distinctive features of our interface. We create a dedicated container for activity updates using `st.container()`, which serves as a dynamic area where research progress appears. When an activity update arrives from the Firecrawl API, the `show_activity_update` function formats it according to its type and displays it in this container. For instance, search activities appear with a magnifying glass emoji, while analysis activities use a brain emoji. This visual differentiation helps users understand the current stage of the research process at a glance. ```python # src/ui.py def show_activity_update(activity_data: Dict[str, Any]): \"\"\"Display an activity update based on the activity data. Args: activity_data (Dict[str, Any]): Activity data from the API \"\"\" # Handle activity displays based on Firecrawl API structure activity_type = activity_data.get(\"type\", \"\") message = activity_data.get(\"message\", \"\") # Map activity types to appropriate icons icon_map = { \"search\": \"🔍\", \"extract\": \"📄\", \"analyze\": \"🧠\", \"reasoning\": \"⚖️\", \"synthesis\": \"✨\", \"thought\": \"💭\", # Default icon for unknown types \"default\": \"🔄\", } # Get the appropriate icon icon = icon_map.get(activity_type, icon_map[\"default\"]) if message: st.markdown(f\"{icon} **{message}**\") ``` The final element of our interface is the results display, which shows both the synthesized research and source citations. We implement an expandable section for sources with `st.expander(\"View Sources\", expanded=False)`, allowing users to see the complete list of references without cluttering the main view. The interface also simulates typewriter-style text appearance using the `simulate_streaming_response` function, which creates the impression of the assistant actively typing out the response. This effect is necessary as the Firecrawl API returns the final analysis as a single block of text, which is not ideal for our purposes. ## Connecting the Components: The Application Core The heart of our application is the `app.py` file, which connects all components into a cohesive system. This file contains the `main()` function that runs when the application starts and the `perform_research()` function that handles the research workflow. When a user submits a query, the application first validates the inputs using functions from `utils.py`, ensuring that the API key is provided and parameters are within acceptable ranges. If validation passes, the application creates an instance of `FirecrawlClient` and prepares a container for displaying activity updates. The workflow follows a clear sequence: receive user query, initialize research, display real-time updates, and present results. ```python def main(): \"\"\"Main application entry point.\"\"\" st.set_page_config( page_title=\"Deep Research Chatbot\", page_icon=\"🔍\", layout=\"wide\" ) # Initialize session state init_session_state() # Set up sidebar and get configuration config = setup_sidebar() # Set up main UI is_query_submitted, query = setup_main_ui() # Display chat history display_chat_history() # Handle query submission if is_query_submitted and not st.session_state.processing: # Validate inputs errors = validate_inputs(config) if errors: for error in errors: show_error(error) else: perform_research(query, config) ``` Real-time updates are implemented through the activity callback system. In the `perform_research()` function, we define `handle_activity_update()` which is passed to the Firecrawl client’s `deep_research()` method. Each time the Firecrawl API reports a new activity (such as starting a search or analyzing results), this function receives the activity data and displays it in the dedicated container. This single line connects the user’s query and settings to the Firecrawl API and establishes the update pipeline. When research completes, the application processes the results using the `format_research_results()` function from `utils.py`. This function takes the raw API response and transforms it into a readable format with proper markdown formatting. It separates the main analysis from the sources, allowing the application to display the analysis directly in the chat and place sources in an expandable section. The code extracts these components using string operations. This approach allows users to focus on the research findings while still having access to the supporting references. The application’s state management ties everything together, maintaining the conversation context between interactions. When research completes, the results are added to the message history stored in `st.session_state.messages`. This allows users to submit multiple queries in a single session. The application also handles errors gracefully, catching exceptions during the research process and displaying appropriate error messages to users. After each research cycle completes or fails, the application resets the processing state flag ( `st.session_state.processing = False`), allowing users to submit new queries. This combination of state management, error handling, and process control creates a robust application that can handle complex research tasks while providing a smooth user experience. ## Enhancing and Extending the Application While our deep research application provides a solid foundation for AI-powered web research, several enhancements could further improve its functionality and user experience. The current implementation prioritizes simplicity and core functionality, but production applications often require additional features to address real-world needs. Adding authentication would allow the application to serve multiple users while tracking API usage per account. Persistent storage of research results would enable users to revisit previous findings without repeating the same queries, potentially using a database like SQLite for smaller deployments or PostgreSQL for larger ones. Here are some key enhancements to consider: - User authentication: Implement a login system to manage multiple users and track API usage - Research history: Store previous queries and results for future reference - Export functionality: Add options to export research results as PDF, Markdown, or Word documents - Customizable research templates: Create predefined research configurations for common use cases - Collaborative features: Enable sharing research sessions with team members - Advanced visualization: Add charts and graphs to represent connections between sources - Offline mode: Cache research results for viewing without internet connectivity ## Conclusion In this article, we’ve built a complete deep research application that transforms how users gather and synthesize information from the web. By leveraging Firecrawl’s deep research endpoint, we’ve created a tool that automatically explores multiple sources, follows contextual threads, and provides comprehensive answers with proper citations. The Streamlit interface makes the research process transparent and interactive, with real-time updates keeping users informed at every step. This open-source implementation demonstrates how AI-powered research capabilities can be made accessible to everyone, providing an alternative to expensive commercial solutions.

Data enrichment is the process of enhancing, refining, and augmenting existing data by combining it with relevant information from multiple sources. This process transforms basic data points into comprehensive, actionable insights that drive better business decisions. ### Understanding data enrichment tools Modern data enrichment tools automate the complex process of collecting and integrating data from diverse sources. These tools typically offer: - Automated data collection from websites, APIs, and databases - Data validation and cleaning capabilities - Schema mapping and transformation features - Integration with existing business systems - Quality assurance and monitoring For example, web scraping engines like Firecrawl enable organizations to automatically structured web data through AI-powered extraction, eliminating the need for manual data gathering while ensuring consistency and accuracy. We will see a complete Firecrawl data enrichment workflow later. ### Types of data enrichment services Data enrichment services generally fall into six main categories: 1. **Demographic** - Adding personal information like age, income, education - Enhancing geographic data with location-specific insights - Including professional and career-related information 2. **Behavioral** - Incorporating customer interaction history - Adding purchase patterns and preferences - Including digital footprint data like website visits and engagement 3. **Company** - Adding firmographic data (company size, revenue, industry) - Including technological stack information - Incorporating business relationships and hierarchies 4. **Psychographic** - Adding personality traits and characteristics - Including personal values and attitudes - Incorporating lifestyle choices and interests - Adding motivation and decision-making patterns 5. **Geographic** - Location intelligence and spatial analysis - Regional market data and demographics - Geographic business opportunities - Local economic indicators - Competitive landscape by region 6. **Contact Data** - Email addresses and phone numbers - Social media profiles - Professional contact details - Business communication preferences - Contact verification and validation These different types of data enrichment services can be combined and integrated to create comprehensive data profiles. For example, combining demographic and behavioral data provides deeper customer insights, while merging company and geographic data enables better B2B market analysis. The key is selecting the right combination of enrichment types based on your specific business needs and objectives. As we move into examining B2B data enrichment specifically, we’ll see how these various enrichment types come together to support business decision-making and growth strategies. ### B2B data enrichment fundamentals B2B data enrichment focuses specifically on enhancing business-related information to improve lead generation, account-based marketing, and sales processes. Key aspects include: - Company verification and validation - Decision-maker identification and contact information - Industry classification and market positioning - Technology stack and tool usage data - Company financial health indicators (e.g., revenue ranges 1−10M,1-10M, 1−10M,10-50M, etc.) - Organizational structure and hierarchy details - Employee count brackets (e.g., 1-50, 51-200, 201-1000) The effectiveness of B2B data enrichment relies heavily on: - Data accuracy and freshness through diverse data sources - Real-time enrichment for time-sensitive data vs. batch processing for static data - Compliance with data protection regulations - Integration with existing CRM and sales tools - Scalability of enrichment processes - Cost-effectiveness and validation across multiple data providers These fundamentals form the foundation for successful B2B data enrichment initiatives. When implemented effectively, they enable organizations to make more informed business decisions and develop targeted strategies for growth. Let’s explore the various tools and services available for data enrichment and how to select the right ones for your needs. ## Data Enrichment Tools and Services Data enrichment tools come in various forms, each serving specific use cases and industries.

These tools provide a foundation for data enrichment, but selecting the right service requires careful evaluation of several key factors. ### Choosing the right data enrichment solution When selecting a data enrichment service, organizations must evaluate several critical factors. Data quality metrics serve as the foundation, with accuracy rates ideally exceeding 95% and response times under 200ms. Services should maintain 99.9% uptime SLAs and provide comprehensive data validation methods. Integration capabilities determine implementation success. Services should offer well-documented REST APIs, support JSON/CSV formats, and connect with major CRM platforms. The ability to handle both real-time and batch processing (up to 100k records/hour) provides essential flexibility. Cost evaluation requires examining API pricing tiers, volume discounts, and hidden fees. Consider vendor reputation, support quality (24/7 availability), and compliance certifications (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2). Regular security audits and data handling practices should meet industry standards. ### Custom data enrichment solutions Custom data enrichment solutions provide organizations with tailored approaches to data enhancement. Web scraping platforms like Firecrawl and Selenium enable automated extraction of public data, while custom APIs facilitate direct integration with specialized data sources. Python frameworks such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Pandas streamline data processing and transformation workflows. Common pitfalls include rate limiting issues, unstable selectors, and data quality inconsistencies. These solutions often incorporate modular architectures for flexibility. Organizations can combine multiple data sources, implement custom validation rules, and design specific enrichment pipelines. Advanced features include proxy rotation for reliable scraping, rate limiting for API compliance, and parallel processing for improved performance. Key challenges include maintaining data consistency across sources and handling API deprecation gracefully. Development of custom solutions requires careful consideration of scalability and maintenance. Teams should implement robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and automated testing. Documentation and version control ensure long-term sustainability, while modular design enables iterative improvements and feature additions. Consider trade-offs between custom development costs versus off-the-shelf solutions - custom solutions typically require 2-3x more initial investment but offer greater control and flexibility. ### Firecrawl as a custom data enrichment solution Firecrawl offers powerful AI-powered scraping capabilities that extend well beyond basic data extraction. Here are some key features that make it an effective data enrichment solution: 1. **Natural language data extraction** Rather than relying on brittle HTML selectors or XPath expressions, Firecrawl allows you to describe the data you want to extract in plain English. This approach works across different website layouts and remains stable even when sites update their structure. For example, you can request “find all pricing tables that show enterprise plan features” or “extract author biographies from the bottom of articles” without specifying exact HTML locations. These capabilities are available through the `scrape_url` method, which is covered in detail in [our guide on using the scrape endpoint](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint). 2. **Recursive website crawling** Beyond scraping individual URLs, Firecrawl can automatically discover and process entire website sections. The crawler understands site structure semantically, following relevant links while avoiding navigation menus, footers, and other non-content areas. This is especially valuable when enriching data from documentation sites, knowledge bases, or product catalogs. Learn more about the crawling process in [our crawl endpoint guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-the-crawl-endpoint-in-firecrawl). 3. **Multiple output formats** The same content can be extracted in different formats to suit your needs: - Structured data for database storage (as shown in our Amazon example) - Markdown for documentation - Plain text for natural language processing - HTML for web archives - Screenshots for visual records This flexibility eliminates the need for additional conversion steps in your data pipeline. 4. **Intelligent content processing** The AI-powered approach helps solve common web scraping challenges: - Automatically detecting and extracting data from tables, lists, and other structured elements - Understanding content relationships and hierarchies - Handling dynamic JavaScript-rendered content - Maintaining context across multiple pages - Filtering out irrelevant content like ads and popups 5. **Integration capabilities** The extracted data can feed directly into modern data and AI workflows: - Vector databases for semantic search - Large language models for analysis - Business intelligence tools for reporting - Machine learning pipelines for training data - Monitoring systems for change detection The key advantage across all these use cases is reduced maintenance overhead. Traditional scrapers require constant updates as websites change, while semantic extraction remains stable. This makes it particularly suitable for long-running data enrichment projects where reliability and consistency are crucial. For a complete example of data enrichment process in Firecrawl, you can read a later section on [Custom Data Enrichment in Python: Amazon Data Case Study](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/complete-guide-to-data-enrichment#custom-data-enrichment-in-python-amazon-data-case-study). ### Product data enrichment solutions Product data enrichment solutions transform basic product information into comprehensive, market-ready datasets.

Sophisticated data synchronization maintains consistency across all connected platforms, with enterprise solutions like [FullContact](https://fullcontact.com/) processing up to 1M records per day. Security and compliance remain paramount in customer data enrichment. Modern platforms incorporate robust GDPR compliance measures and granular data privacy controls, typically costing $0.05-0.15 per enriched record at scale. They maintain detailed audit trails and provide comprehensive consent management systems to protect both organizations and their customers. The key to successful data enrichment lies in selecting tools that align with your specific use cases while maintaining data quality and compliance standards. Best practices include refreshing enriched data every 3-6 months and implementing data quality monitoring. Organizations should start with a pilot program using one or two tools before scaling to a full implementation, with typical ROI ranging from 3-5x for marketing use cases and 5-8x for sales applications. ## B2B Data Enrichment: A Complete Guide B2B data enrichment has become increasingly critical for organizations seeking to enhance their business intelligence and decision-making capabilities.

This Kaggle-hosted dataset provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how to enrich outdated product information. ### Exploring the Amazon listings dataset First, we should download the dataset stored as a ZIP file on Kaggle servers. These commands pull that zip file and extract the CSV file inside in your current working directory: ```bash # Download the zip file curl -L -o amazon-product-dataset-2020.zip\\ https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020 unzip amazon-product-dataset-2020.zip # Move the desired file and rename it mv home/sdf/marketing_sample_for_amazon_com-ecommerce__20200101_20200131__10k_data.csv amazon_listings.csv # Delete unnecessary files rm -rf home amazon-product-dataset-2020.zip ``` Next, let’s install a few dependencies we are going to use: ```bash pip install pandas firecrawl-py pydantic python-dotenv ``` Now, we can load the dataset with Pandas to explore it: ```python import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(\"amazon_listings.csv\") df.shape ``` ```out (10002, 28) ``` There are 10k products with 28 attributes: ```python df.columns ``` ```out Index( [\\ 'Uniq Id', 'Product Name', 'Brand Name', 'Asin', 'Category',\\ 'Upc Ean Code', 'List Price', 'Selling Price', 'Quantity',\\ 'Model Number', 'About Product', 'Product Specification',\\ 'Technical Details', 'Shipping Weight', 'Product Dimensions', 'Image',\\ 'Variants', 'Sku', 'Product Url', 'Stock', 'Product Details',\\ 'Dimensions', 'Color', 'Ingredients', 'Direction To Use',\\ 'Is Amazon Seller', 'Size Quantity Variant', 'Product Description'\\ ], dtype='object' ) ``` For ecommerce listing datasets, missing values are the main problem. Let’s see if that’s true of this one: ```python null_percentages = df.isnull().sum() / df.shape[0] null_percentages.sort_values(ascending=False) ``` ```out Product Description 1.000000 Sku 1.000000 Brand Name 1.000000 Asin 1.000000 Size Quantity Variant 1.000000 List Price 1.000000 Direction To Use 1.000000 Quantity 1.000000 Ingredients 1.000000 Color 1.000000 Dimensions 1.000000 Product Details 1.000000 Stock 1.000000 Upc Ean Code 0.996601 Product Dimensions 0.952110 Variants 0.752250 Model Number 0.177165 Product Specification 0.163167 Shipping Weight 0.113777 Category 0.082983 Technical Details 0.078984 About Product 0.027295 Selling Price 0.010698 Image 0.000000 Product Name 0.000000 Product Url 0.000000 Is Amazon Seller 0.000000 Uniq Id 0.000000 dtype: float64 ``` Based on the output, we can see that almost 15 attributes are missing for all products while some have partially incomplete data. Only five attributes are fully present: - Unique ID - Is Amazon Seller - Product URL - Product Name - Image Even when details are present, we can’t count on them since they were recorded in 2020 and have probably changed. So, our goal is to enrich this data with updated information as well as filling in the missing columns as best as possible. ### Enriching Amazon listings data with Firecrawl Now that we’ve explored the dataset and identified missing information, let’s use Firecrawl to enrich our Amazon product data. We’ll create a schema that defines what information we want to extract from each product URL. First, let’s import the required libraries and initialize Firecrawl: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv from pydantic import BaseModel, Field load_dotenv() app = FirecrawlApp() ``` Next, we’ll define a Pydantic model that describes the product information we want to extract. This schema helps Firecrawl’s AI understand what data to look for on each product page: ```python class Product(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"The name of the product\") image: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the product image\") brand: str = Field(description=\"The seller or brand of the product\") category: str = Field(description=\"The category of the product\") price: float = Field(description=\"The current price of the product\") rating: float = Field(description=\"The rating of the product\") reviews: int = Field(description=\"The number of reviews of the product\") description: str = Field(description=\"The description of the product written below its price.\") dimensions: str = Field(description=\"The dimensions of the product written below its technical details.\") weight: str = Field(description=\"The weight of the product written below its technical details.\") in_stock: bool = Field(description=\"Whether the product is in stock\") ``` For demonstration purposes, let’s take the last 100 product URLs from our dataset and enrich them: ```python # Get last 100 URLs urls = df['Product Url'].tolist()[-100:] # Start batch scraping job batch_scrape_data = app.batch_scrape_urls(urls, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": {\"schema\": Product.model_json_schema()} }) ``` Here are the results of the batch-scraping job: ```python # Separate successful and failed scrapes failed_items = [\\ item for item in batch_scrape_data[\"data\"] if item[\"metadata\"][\"statusCode\"] != 200\\ ] success_items = [\\ item for item in batch_scrape_data[\"data\"] if item[\"metadata\"][\"statusCode\"] == 200\\ ] print(f\"Successfully scraped: {len(success_items)} products\") print(f\"Failed to scrape: {len(failed_items)} products\") ``` ```out Successfully scraped: 84 products Failed to scrape: 16 products ``` Let’s examine a successful enrichment result: ```python { 'extract': { 'name': 'Leffler Home Kids Chair, Red', 'brand': 'Leffler Home', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IcFQJ8n4L._AC_SX355_.jpg', 'price': 0, 'rating': 0, 'weight': '26 Pounds', 'reviews': 0, 'category': \"Kids' Furniture\", 'in_stock': False, 'dimensions': '20\"D x 24\"W x 21\"H', 'description': 'Every child deserves their own all mine chair...' }, 'metadata': { 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/Leffler-Home-14000-21-63-01-Kids-Chair/dp/B0784BXPC2', 'statusCode': 200, # ... other metadata } } ``` A few observations about the enrichment results: 1. **Success Rate**: Out of 100 URLs, we successfully enriched 84 products. The 16 failures were mostly due to products no longer being available on Amazon (404 errors). 2. **Data Quality**: For successful scrapes, we obtained all desired details, including: - Complete product dimensions and weights - Updated category information - Current availability status - High-resolution image URLs - Detailed product descriptions 3. **Missing Values**: Some numeric fields (price, rating, reviews) returned 0 for unavailable products, which we should handle in our data cleaning step. For large-scale enrichment, Firecrawl also offers an asynchronous API that can handle thousands of URLs: ```python # Start async batch job batch_job = app.async_batch_scrape_urls( urls, params={\"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": {\"schema\": Product.model_json_schema()}}, ) # Check job status until it finishes job_status = app.check_batch_scrape_status(batch_job[\"id\"]) ``` This approach is particularly useful when enriching the entire dataset of 10,000+ products, as it allows you to monitor progress and handle results in chunks rather than waiting for all URLs to complete. In the next section, we’ll explore how to merge this enriched data back into our original dataset and handle any discrepancies between old and new information. ## Conclusion Data enrichment has become essential for organizations seeking to maintain competitive advantage through high-quality, comprehensive datasets. Through this guide, we’ve explored how modern tools and techniques can streamline the enrichment process. ### Key Takeaways - Start with clear data quality objectives and metrics - Choose enrichment tools based on your specific use case and scale - Implement proper validation and error handling - Consider both batch and real-time enrichment approaches - Maintain data freshness through regular updates ### Implementation Steps - Audit your current data to identify gaps - Select appropriate enrichment sources and tools - Build a scalable enrichment pipeline - Implement quality monitoring - Schedule regular data refresh cycles ### Additional Resources - [Firecrawl Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/) \\- Official documentation for implementing data enrichment with Firecrawl - [Web Scraping Ethics Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01?gi=3bb0cd74a4e3) \\- Best practices for ethical web scraping - [Clearbit API Documentation](https://clearbit.com/docs) \\- Detailed guides for company and person data enrichment - [FullContact Developer Portal](https://docs.fullcontact.com/) \\- Resources for identity resolution and customer data enrichment - [ZoomInfo API Reference](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/) \\- Documentation for B2B data enrichment - [Modern Data Stack Blog](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/) \\- Latest trends and best practices in data engineering - [dbt Developer Blog](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog) \\- Insights on data transformation and modeling By following these guidelines and leveraging modern tools, organizations can build robust data enrichment pipelines that provide lasting value for their data-driven initiatives.

This tool enables you to compile your entire website into a single text file that can be used with any Large Language Model (LLM), improving how AI interacts with your content. ### What is an llms.txt File? An `llms.txt` file is a standardized markdown file proposed by Jeremy Howard to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time. Unlike traditional web content designed for human readers, `llms.txt` files offer concise, structured information that LLMs can quickly ingest. This is particularly useful for enhancing development environments, providing documentation for programming libraries, and offering structured overviews for various domains such as corporate websites, educational institutions, and personal portfolios. The `llms.txt` file is located at the root path `/llms.txt` of a website and contains sections in a specific order, including a project name, a summary, detailed information, and file lists with URLs for further details. This format allows LLMs to efficiently access and process the most important information about a website. ### Introducing llms.txt Generator ✨ The llms.txt Generator leverages [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) to crawl your website and extracts data using **gpt-4o-mini**. You can generate both `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files through the web interface or via API. ### Accessing llms.txt via API You can access `llms.txt` directly by making a GET request to: ``` http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/{YOUR_URL} ``` For the full version, use: ``` http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/{YOUR_URL}/full ``` If you have a Firecrawl API key, you can include it to unlock full results and remove limits: ``` http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/{YOUR_URL}?FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY ``` For the full version with API key: ``` http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/{YOUR_URL}/full?FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY ``` ### How to Generate Your llms.txt File 1. **Visit the Generator**: Go to [http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev](http://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/). 2. **Enter Your Website URL**: Input the URL of your website. 3. **Generate the File**: Click the generate button and wait a few minutes as the tool processes your site. 4. **Download Your Files**: Once ready, download the `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files. ### No API Key Required, But Recommended While an API key is not required, using a free Firecrawl API key removes any usage limits and provides full access to all features. ### Learn More and Get Involved - **llms.txt Standard**: Discover more about the `llms.txt` standard at [http://llmstxt.org](http://llmstxt.org/). - **Directory of Adopters**: Check out the directory of `llms.txt` adopters at [http://directory.llmstxt.cloud](http://directory.llmstxt.cloud/). - **Contribute**: The llms.txt Generator is open source.

We’ll cover what it does, why it matters, and how to use it effectively in your web development workflow. Website mapping has become increasingly critical in modern web development. As sites grow more complex with dynamic content and single-page applications, having a clear understanding of a site’s structure and URL hierarchy is essential for navigation and URL discovery. The /map endpoint helps solve common challenges like keeping track of site structure, identifying broken links, and ensuring search engines can properly crawl and index your content.

Put simply, a sitemap is a list or a diagram that communicates the structure of web pages in a website. It is useful for a number of reasons. First, it helps developers, and site owners understand and maintain their website’s structure. Having a clear overview of how pages are connected makes it easier to manage content, identify navigation issues, and ensure a logical flow for users. Second, sitemaps are crucial for SEO. Search engines use sitemaps to discover and index pages more efficiently. A well-structured sitemap helps ensure all your important content gets crawled and indexed properly. Third, sitemaps can help identify potential issues like broken links, orphaned pages (pages with no incoming links), or circular references. This makes troubleshooting and maintenance much more manageable. Finally, sitemaps are valuable for an AI agents to discover and navigate around websites, finding information faster than clicking through traditional navigation. ### Guide to Sitemap Types: Visual vs XML Sitemaps There are two main types of sitemaps: visual and XML. Visual sitemaps are diagrams or flowcharts that show how websites are structured at-a-glance. They typically use boxes, lines, and other visual elements to represent pages and their relationships. These visual representations make it easy for stakeholders, designers, and developers to quickly understand site hierarchy, navigation paths, and content organization. They’re particularly useful during the planning and design phases of web development, as well as for communicating site structure to non-technical team members. Source: [Flowapp](https://www.flowmapp.com/features/generate-sitemap-online) XML sitemaps are shown to the public much less frequently because they contain structured XML code that can look intimidating to non-technical users. But an XML sitemap is just an organized file containing all the URLs of a website that is readable to search engines. It includes important metadata about each URL like when it was last modified, how often it changes, and its relative importance. Search engines like Google use this information to crawl websites more intelligently and ensure all important pages are indexed. While XML sitemaps aren’t meant for human consumption, they play a vital role in SEO and are often required for large websites to achieve optimal search engine visibility. Source: [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/sitemap/es/tutorial/category.xml) ### How Firecrawl’s `/map` Endpoint Solves These Challenges When you are building a website from scratch, you usually need a visual sitemap and can develop the XML one over the time as you add more pages. However, if you neglected these steps early on and suddenly find yourself with a massive website, possibly with thousands of URLs, creating either type of sitemap manually becomes an overwhelming task. This is where automated solutions like the `/map` endpoint can become invaluable. The real challenge of mapping existing sites is finding all the URLs that exist on your website. Without automated tools, you’d need to manually click through every link, record every URL, and track which pages link to which others. Traditional web scraping solutions using Python libraries like `beautifulsoup`, `scrapy` or `lxml` can automate this process but they can quickly become useless when dealing with modern web applications that heavily rely on JavaScript for rendering content, use complex authentication systems, or implement rate limiting and bot detection. These traditional approaches are not only time-consuming but also error-prone, as it’s easy to miss URLs in JavaScript-rendered content, dynamically generated pages, or deeply nested navigation menus. The `/map` endpoint solves these challenges and provides the fastest and easiest solution to go from a single URL to a map of the entire website. The /map endpoint is particularly useful in scenarios where: - You want to give end-users control over which links to scrape by presenting them with options - Rapid discovery of all available links on a website is crucial - You need to focus on topic-specific content, you can use the search parameter to find relevant pages - You only want to extract data from particular sections of a website rather than crawling everything ### Limitations of `/map` in the alpha stage While the /map endpoint is still in alpha stage, it has some limitations. The endpoint prioritizes speed so it may not capture all website links. The vision for this endpoint is to maintain its blazing-fast speed and still capture every single link in a given website. Feedback and suggestions are welcome. ## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the /map Endpoint Firecrawl is a scraping engine exposed as a REST API, which means you can use it from the command-line using cURL or by using one of its SDKs in Python, Node, Go or Rust. In this tutorial, we will use its Python SDK, so please install it in your environment: ```bash pip install firecrawl-py ``` The next step is obtaining a Firecrawl API key by signing up at [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and choosing a plan (the free plan is fine for this tutorial). Once you have your API key, you should save it in a .env file, which provides a secure way to store sensitive credentials without exposing them in your code: ```bash touch .env echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='YOUR-API-KEY'\" >> .env ``` Then, you should install python-dotenv to automatically load the variables in `.env` files in Python scripts and notebooks: ```bash pip install python-dotenv ``` Then, using the /map endpoint is as easy as the following code: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv() app = FirecrawlApp() response = app.map_url(url=\"https://firecrawl.dev\") ``` In this code snippet, we’re using the Firecrawl Python SDK to map a URL. Let’s break down what’s happening: First, we import two key components: - FirecrawlApp from the firecrawl package, which provides the main interface to interact with Firecrawl’s API - `load_dotenv` from `dotenv` to load our environment variables containing the API key After importing, we initialize a FirecrawlApp instance, which automatically picks up our API key from the environment variables. Finally, we make a request to map the URL `https://firecrawl.dev` using the `map_url()` method. This crawls the website and returns information about its structure and pages, taking about two seconds on my machine (the speed may vary based on internet speeds). Let’s look at the `response` dictionary: ```python response.keys() ``` ```python dict_keys(['success', 'links']) ``` It only has two keys: ‘success’ and ‘links’. The ‘success’ key indicates whether the request was successful, and the ‘links’ key contains the URLs found on the website: ```python len(response['links']) ``` ```python 98 ``` ## Further Configuration Options for Website Mapping ### Optimizing URL discovery with `search` parameter The most notable feature of the endpoint is its `search` parameter. This parameter allows you to filter the URLs returned by the crawler based on specific patterns or criteria. For example, you can use it to only retrieve URLs containing certain keywords or matching specific paths. This makes it incredibly useful for focused crawling tasks where you’re only interested in a subset of pages for massive websites. Let’s use this feature on the Stripe documentation and only search for pages related to taxes: ```python url = \"https://docs.stripe.com\" response = app.map_url(url=url, params={\"search\": \"tax\"}) ``` The response structure will be the same: ```python response[\"links\"][:10] ``` ```python ['https://docs.stripe.com/tax',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/how-tax-works',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/calculating',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes',\\ 'https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates'] ``` Let’s count up the found links: ```python len(response[\"links\"]) ``` ```out 2677 ``` More than 2600 in only three seconds! ### Essential `/map` parameters for customized site mappning There are some additional parameters /map accepts to control its behavior: **`ignoreSitemap`** - Type: boolean - Default: true - Description: When set to true, the crawler will not attempt to parse or use the website’s `sitemap.xml` file during crawling. This can be useful when you want to discover pages through navigation links only. **`sitemapOnly`** - Type: boolean - Default: false - Description: When enabled, the crawler will exclusively return URLs found in the website’s sitemap files, ignoring any links discovered through page crawling. This is useful for quickly indexing officially published pages. **`includeSubdomains`** - Type: boolean - Default: false - Description: Controls whether the crawler should follow and return links to subdomains (e.g., blog.example.com when crawling example.com). Enabling this provides a more comprehensive view of the entire web property. **`limit`** - Type: integer - Default: 5000 - Description: Specifies the maximum number of URLs the crawler will return in a single request. This helps manage response sizes and processing time. Must be less than 5000 to prevent excessive server load for the time being. - Required range: x ` element and adds several child elements: - ``: Contains the actual URL - ``: Set to today’s date to indicate when the page was last modified - ``: Set to “monthly” to suggest how often the page content changes - ``: Set to “0.5” to indicate the relative importance of the page This creates a properly formatted sitemap entry for each URL following the Sitemap XML protocol specifications. After the loop finishes, we create and return the XML string: ```python def create_xml_sitemap(urls, base_url): ... # Add each URL to the sitemap for url in urls: ... # Create the XML string return ET.tostring(urlset, encoding=\"unicode\", method=\"xml\") ``` Here is the full function: ```python def create_xml_sitemap(urls, base_url): # Create the root element urlset = ET.Element(\"urlset\") urlset.set(\"xmlns\", \"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\") # Get current date for lastmod today = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") # Add each URL to the sitemap for url in urls: # Only include URLs from the same domain if urlparse(url).netloc == urlparse(base_url).netloc: url_element = ET.SubElement(urlset, \"url\") loc = ET.SubElement(url_element, \"loc\") loc.text = url # Add optional elements lastmod = ET.SubElement(url_element, \"lastmod\") lastmod.text = today changefreq = ET.SubElement(url_element, \"changefreq\") changefreq.text = \"monthly\" priority = ET.SubElement(url_element, \"priority\") priority.text = \"0.5\" # Create the XML string return ET.tostring(urlset, encoding=\"unicode\", method=\"xml\") ``` Let’s use the function on the links returned by the last `/map` endpoint use: ```python base_url = \"https://books.toscrape.com\" links = map_response[\"links\"] xml_sitemap = create_xml_sitemap(links, base_url) # Save to file with open(\"sitemap.xml\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f: f.write('\\n') f.write(xml_sitemap) ``` Here is what the file looks like after saving: Such `sitemap.xml` file provides a standardized way for search engines to discover and crawl all pages on your website. ## Advanced Visualization: Building Interactive Visual Sitemaps with `/map` If you want a visual sitemap of a website, you don’t have to sign up for expensive third-party services and platforms. You can automatically generate one using the `/map` endpoint, Plotly and a few other libraries. The resulting graph would like the following: The Sankey diagram above visualizes the hierarchical structure of [the Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.org/) (which is quite large) by showing how pages are organized and connected across different sections. The width of each flow represents the number of pages in that section, making it easy to identify which parts of the website contain the most content. The colors help distinguish between different sections and their subsections. The diagram starts from a central root node and branches out into main sections of the website. Each section can then split further into subsections, creating a tree-like visualization of the site’s architecture. This makes it simple to understand the overall organization and identify potential navigation or structural issues. For example, you can quickly spot which sections are the largest (the API section), how content is distributed across different areas, and whether there’s a logical grouping of related pages. This visualization is particularly useful for content strategists, SEO specialists, and web architects who need to analyze and optimize website structure. [The script that generated this plot](https://github.com/FirstClassML/firecrawl_articles/blob/main/3_generating_sitemap/sitemap_generator.py) contains more than 400 lines of code and I made it fully customizable. The code in `sitemap_generator.py` follows a modular, object-oriented approach with several key components: 1. A `HierarchyBuilder` class that analyzes URLs returned my `/map` or `/crawl` and builds a tree-like data structure up to 4 levels deep. 2. A `SankeyDataPreparator` class that transforms this hierarchy into a format suitable for visualization, using thresholds to control complexity 3. A `SitemapVisualizer` class that creates the final Sankey diagram with proper styling and interactivity The script automatically handles things like grouping smaller sections together, truncating long labels, generating color schemes, and adding hover information (the generated plots are all interactive through Plotly). All aspects like minimum branch size, relative thresholds, label length, and color schemes can be customized through parameters. Here is another plot generated for the [PyData.org](https://pydata.org/) website: ## Conclusion The `/map` endpoint represents a powerful tool in the modern web developer’s toolkit, offering a fast and efficient way to discover and analyze website structures. While still in alpha, it provides significant advantages: - **Speed**: As demonstrated, it’s significantly faster than traditional crawling methods, making it ideal for quick site analysis - **Flexibility**: With parameters like `search`, `sitemapOnly`, and `includeSubdomains`, it can be tailored to specific needs - **Practical Applications**: From generating XML sitemaps for SEO to creating visual site hierarchies, the endpoint serves multiple use cases While it may not capture every single URL compared to full crawling solutions, its speed and ease of use make it an excellent choice for rapid site mapping and initial structure analysis. As the endpoint continues to evolve, its combination of performance and accuracy will make it an increasingly valuable tool for website maintenance, SEO optimization, and content strategy.

OpenAI’s new Predicted Outputs feature introduces a way to significantly reduce response times by informing the model about the expected output in advance. In this article, we’ll explore how to use Predicted Outputs with the GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models to make your AI applications super fast 🚀. We’ll also provide a practical example of transforming blog posts into SEO-optimized content, a powerful use case enabled by this feature. ### What Are Predicted Outputs? Predicted Outputs allow you to provide the LLM with an anticipated output, especially useful when most of the response is known ahead of time. For tasks like rewriting text with minor modifications, this can drastically reduce the time it takes for the model to generate the desired result. ### Why Use Predicted Outputs? By supplying the model with a prediction of the output, you: - **Reduce Latency:** The model can process and generate responses faster because it doesn’t need to generate the entire output from scratch. - **Enhance Efficiency:** Useful when you can reasonably assume that large portions of the output will remain unchanged. ### Limitations to Keep in Mind While Predicted Outputs are powerful, there are some limitations: - Supported only with **GPT-4o** and **GPT-4o-mini** models. - Certain API parameters are not supported, such as `n` values greater than 1, `logprobs`, `presence_penalty` greater than 0, among others. ### How to Use Predicted Outputs Let’s dive into how you can implement Predicted Outputs in your application. We’ll walk through an example where we optimize a blog post by adding internal links to relevant pages within the same website. #### Prerequisites Make sure you have the following installed: ```bash pip install firecrawl-py openai ``` #### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment Initialize the necessary libraries and load your API keys. ```python import os import json from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv from openai import OpenAI # Load environment variables load_dotenv() # Retrieve API keys from environment variables firecrawl_api_key = os.getenv(\"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\") openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") # Initialize the FirecrawlApp and OpenAI client app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=firecrawl_api_key) client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key) ``` #### Step 2: Scrape the Blog Content We’ll start by scraping the content of a blog post that we want to optimize. ```python # Get the blog URL (you can input your own) blog_url = \"https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/how-to-use-openai-o1-reasoning-models-in-applications\" # Scrape the blog content in markdown format blog_scrape_result = app.scrape_url(blog_url, params={'formats': ['markdown']}) blog_content = blog_scrape_result.get('markdown', '') ``` #### Step 3: Map the Website for Internal Links Next, we’ll get a list of other pages on the website to which we can add internal links. ```python # Extract the top-level domain top_level_domain = '/'.join(blog_url.split('/')[:3]) # Map the website to get all internal links site_map = app.map_url(top_level_domain) site_links = site_map.get('links', []) ``` #### Step 4: Prepare the Prompt and Prediction We’ll create a prompt instructing the model to add internal links to the blog post and provide the original content as a prediction. ```python prompt = f\"\"\" You are an AI assistant helping to improve a blog post. Here is the original blog post content: {blog_content} Here is a list of other pages on the website: {json.dumps(site_links, indent=2)} Please revise the blog post to include internal links to some of these pages where appropriate. Make sure the internal links are relevant and enhance the content. Only return the revised blog post in markdown format. \"\"\" ``` #### Step 5: Use Predicted Outputs with the OpenAI API Now, we’ll call the OpenAI API using the `prediction` parameter to provide the existing content. ```python completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", messages=[\\ {\\ \"role\": \"user\",\\ \"content\": prompt\\ }\\ ], prediction={ \"type\": \"content\", \"content\": blog_content } ) revised_blog_post = completion.choices[0].message.content ``` #### Step 6: Compare the Original and Revised Content Finally, we’ll compare the number of links in the original and revised blog posts to see the improvements. ```python import re def count_links(markdown_content): return len(re.findall(r'\\[.*?\\]\\(.*?\\)', markdown_content)) original_links_count = count_links(blog_content) revised_links_count = count_links(revised_blog_post) print(f\"Number of links in the original blog post: {original_links_count}\") print(f\"Number of links in the revised blog post: {revised_links_count}\") ``` ### Conclusion By utilizing Predicted Outputs, you can significantly speed up tasks where most of the output is known, such as content reformatting or minor edits. This feature is a game-changer for developers looking to optimize performance without compromising on the quality of the output. That’s it! In this article, we’ve shown you how to get started with Predicted Outputs using OpenAI’s GPT-4o models. Whether you’re transforming content, correcting errors, or making minor adjustments, Predicted Outputs can make your AI applications faster and more efficient. ### References - [Using Predicted Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization#use-predicted-outputs) - [Firecrawl Documentation](https://www.firecrawl.dev/docs) Article updated recently [🔥](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) ## Ready to _Build?_ Start scraping web data for your AI apps today.

These models are designed to “think before they answer,” producing extensive internal chains of thought before responding. In this guide, we’ll explore how to integrate these powerful models into your applications, with a practical example of crawling a website using the `o1-preview` model. ## Introduction to o1 Models The o1 models are large language models trained with reinforcement learning to excel in complex reasoning tasks. There are two models available: 1. **o1-preview**: An early preview designed for reasoning about hard problems using broad general knowledge. 2. **o1-mini**: A faster, cost-effective version ideal for coding, math, and science tasks that don’t require extensive general knowledge. While these models offer significant advancements, they are not intended to replace GPT-4o in all use cases. If your application requires image inputs, function calling, or consistent fast response times, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini remain the optimal choices. ## Getting Started with o1 Models in Your Applications To demonstrate how to integrate the o1 models into your apps, we’ll walk through a practical example: crawling a website to find specific information using the `o1-preview` model. ### Prerequisites Ensure you have the following libraries installed: ```bash pip install firecrawl-py openai ``` ### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries We’ll start by importing the required modules. ```python import os from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp import json from dotenv import load_dotenv from openai import OpenAI ``` ### Step 2: Load Environment Variables We’ll use environment variables to securely manage our API keys. ```python # Load environment variables load_dotenv() # Retrieve API keys from environment variables firecrawl_api_key = os.getenv(\"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\") openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ``` ### Step 3: Initialize the FirecrawlApp and OpenAI Client ```python # Initialize the FirecrawlApp and OpenAI client app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=firecrawl_api_key) client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key) ``` ### Step 4: Define the Objective and URL Set the website you want to crawl and the objective of the crawl. ```python url = \"https://example.com\" objective = \"Find the contact email for customer support\" ``` ### Step 5: Determine the Search Parameter Using o1-preview We’ll use the `o1-preview` model to come up with a 1-2 word search parameter based on our objective. ```python map_prompt = f\"\"\" The map function generates a list of URLs from a website and accepts a search parameter. Based on the objective: {objective}, suggest a 1-2 word search parameter to find the needed information. Only respond with 1-2 words. \"\"\" # Highlighted OpenAI call completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"o1-preview\", messages=[\\ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": map_prompt}\\ ] ) map_search_parameter = completion.choices[0].message.content.strip() ``` ### Step 6: Map the Website Using the Search Parameter Use the `firecrawl` app to map the website and find relevant links. ```python map_website = app.map_url(url, params={\"search\": map_search_parameter}) ``` ### Step 7: Scrape the Top Pages and Check for the Objective We’ll scrape the top links from the mapping result and check if they meet our objective. ```python # Get top 3 links top_links = map_website[:3] if isinstance(map_website, list) else [] for link in top_links: # Scrape the page scrape_result = app.scrape_url(link, params={'formats': ['markdown']}) # Check if objective is met check_prompt = f\"\"\" Given the following scraped content and objective, determine if the objective is met with high confidence. If it is, extract the relevant information in a simple and concise JSON format. If the objective is not met with high confidence, respond with 'Objective not met'. Objective: {objective} Scraped content: {scrape_result['markdown']} \"\"\" completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"o1-preview\", messages=[\\ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": check_prompt}\\ ] ) result = completion.choices[0].message.content.strip() if result != \"Objective not met\": try: extracted_info = json.loads(result) break except json.JSONDecodeError: continue else: extracted_info = None ``` ### Step 8: Display the Extracted Information ```python if extracted_info: print(\"Extracted Information:\") print(json.dumps(extracted_info, indent=2)) else: print(\"Objective not met with the available content.\") ``` ## Conclusion In this article, we’ve explored how to integrate OpenAI’s new o1 reasoning models into your applications to perform complex tasks like crawling a website and extracting specific information. The o1 models showcase impressive capabilities in reasoning and problem-solving, making them valuable tools for developers tackling challenging AI tasks. Whether you’re working on advanced coding problems, mathematical computations, or intricate scientific queries, the o1 models can significantly enhance your application’s reasoning abilities. **Happy coding!** ## References - [OpenAI’s Documentation on o1 Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1) - [Firecrawl Documentation](https://firecrawl.com/docs) Article updated recently [🔥](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) ## Ready to _Build?_ Start scraping web data for your AI apps today.

We’ll create the interface first and add features one at a time. This is different from the usual way of building applications that start with back-end (databases), but it will make it easier to understand how everything fits together. Think of it like building a car - we’ll start with the steering wheel and seats that people interact with, then add the engine and other parts that make it work. ### Step 1: Project setup First, let’s set up our project environment. Create a new directory and initialize it with Poetry: ```bash mkdir competitor-price-monitor cd competitor-price-monitor poetry init ``` [Poetry](https://www.python-poetry.org/) is a modern dependency management and packaging tool for Python that makes it easy to manage project dependencies, virtual environments, and package distribution. It provides a simpler and more intuitive way to handle Python project dependencies compared to `pip` and `requirements.txt` files. Read this [Poetry starter guide](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-poetry) if you are unfamiliar with the tool. When you run the `poetry init` command, Poetry asks some questions to set up your project. When asked for the Python version, type `^3.10`. When asked for specifying dependencies interactively, type “no”. You can press ENTER for other questions. Next, you should create this basic project structure: ```bash competitor-price-monitor/ ├── src/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── app.py │ ├── database.py │ ├── scraper.py │ └── check_prices.py ├── .env ├── .gitignore ├── pyproject.toml # Automatically created by poetry └── README.md ``` Here are the commands: ```bash mkdir -p src touch src/{__init__.py,app.py,database.py,scraper.py,check_prices.py} touch .env .gitignore README.md # Create .gitignore content cat .gitignore __pycache__/ *.py[cod] *.egg-info/ .env .venv/ .idea/ .vscode/ *.db *.log .DS_Store EOF ``` Next, you should install the necessary dependencies with Poetry: ```bash poetry add streamlit firecrawl-py sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv pandas plotly ``` This command automatically resolves dependency versions and adds them to `pyproject.toml` file, which will be crucial later on. Let’s initialize Git and commit the changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" ``` Finally, start the Streamlit server to see app updates as you change the `src/app.py` file in the coming sections. ```bash poetry run streamlit run src/app.py ``` ### Step 2: Add a sidebar to the UI for product input Let’s start building the UI inside `src/app.py`: ```python import streamlit as st def main(): st.title(\"Competitor Price Monitor\") st.markdown( \"##### Compare your product prices to competitors' prices. Input your product details and competitors' URLs to get started.\" ) st.markdown(\"### Tracked Products\") st.markdown(\"---\") # Sidebar for adding new products with st.sidebar: st.header(\"Add New Product\") add_product() def add_product(): pass if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() ``` We begin by defining a `main` function that sets up the core UI components - a title, description, and section for tracked products in the main area, along with a sidebar containing a form to add new products using the `add_product` function. Let’s define it next: ```python # src/app.py ... def add_product(): \"\"\"Form to add a new product\"\"\" with st.form(\"add_product\"): name = st.text_input(\"Product name\") price = st.number_input(\"Your price\", min_value=0) url = st.text_input(\"Product URL (optional)\") if st.form_submit_button(\"Add product\"): st.success(f\"Added product: {name}\") return True return False ``` The `add_product` function creates a form in the sidebar that allows users to input details for a new product they want to track. It collects the product name, price, and an optional URL. For now, when submitted, it displays a success message and returns True. In the next step, we will set up a database to store products added through this form. For now, your app must be looking like this: Let’s commit the latest changes now: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a form to collect new products\" ``` ### Step 3: Store new products in PostgreSQL table To capture products entered through the form, we need an online database. In this case, Postgres is the best option since it’s reliable and scalable. There are many platforms for hosting Postgres instances but the one I find the easiest and fastest to set up is Supabase. So, please head over to [the Supabase website](https://supabase.com/) and create your free account. During the sign-up process, you will be given a password, which you should save somewhere safe on your machine. Then, in a few minutes, your free Postgres instance comes online. To connect to this instance, click on Home in the left sidebar and then, “Connect”: The menu displays different ways to connect to your database. We’ll use the connection URI with transaction pooling enabled, as this provides the best balance of performance and reliability. So, copy the “Transaction pooler” URI and return to your working environment. Open the `.env` file you created in the project setup step and paste the following variable: ```bash POSTGRES_URL=\"THE-SUPABASE-URL-STRING-WITH-YOUR-PASSWORD-ADDED\" ``` The connection string contains a `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder which you should replace with the password you copied when creating your Supabase account and project (remove the brackets). Then, open `src/database.py` and paste the following code: ```python # src/database.py from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship, declarative_base from datetime import datetime import uuid Base = declarative_base() class Product(Base): __tablename__ = \"products\" id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())) name = Column(String, nullable=False) your_price = Column(Float, nullable=False) url = Column(String) ``` The code above defines a SQLAlchemy model for storing product information in a PostgreSQL database. SQLAlchemy is a powerful Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with databases. Key benefits of SQLAlchemy include: - Writing database operations using Python classes and methods instead of raw SQL - Automatic handling of database connections and transactions - Database-agnostic code that works across different SQL databases - Built-in security features to prevent SQL injection The `Product` model defines a table with the following columns: - `id`: A unique identifier generated using UUID4 - `name`: The product name (required) - `your_price`: The product’s price in your store (required) - `url`: The product URL (optional) The model uses SQLAlchemy’s declarative base system which automatically maps Python classes to database tables. When we create the tables, SQLAlchemy will generate the appropriate SQL schema based on these class definitions. Now, return `src/app.py` and make the following below. 1. Change the imports: ```python import os from database import Product, Base from dotenv import load_dotenv from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker import streamlit as st ``` 2. Load environment variables from `.env` and set up the database: ```python # Load environment variables load_dotenv() # Database setup - creates the tables we specify engine = create_engine(os.getenv(\"POSTGRES_URL\")) Base.metadata.create_all(engine) Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) ``` The code above sets up the core database infrastructure for our application. First, it loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`, which allows us to securely store sensitive information like database credentials. Then it initializes the `SQLAlchemy` engine by creating a connection to our PostgreSQL database using the `POSTGRES_URL` from our environment variables. The `create_all()` call creates any database tables that don’t already exist, based on the models we defined (like the `Product` model). Finally, it creates a Session factory using `sessionmaker`. Sessions handle database transactions and provide an interface for querying and modifying data. Each database operation will create a new `Session` instance to ensure thread safety. 3. Update the `add_product()` function: ```python def add_product(): \"\"\"Form to add a new product\"\"\" with st.form(\"add_product\"): name = st.text_input(\"Product name\") price = st.number_input(\"Your price\", min_value=0) url = st.text_input(\"Product URL (optional)\") if st.form_submit_button(\"Add product\"): session = Session() product = Product(name=name, your_price=price, url=url) session.add(product) session.commit() session.close() st.success(f\"Added product: {name}\") return True return False ``` This time, when the form is submitted, a new Product instance is created and saved to the database using SQLAlchemy’s session management. * * * The rest of the script stays the same. Now, try adding a few products through the form - the functionality stays the same but the products are captured in the database. Then, commit the latest changes to Git: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Connect the sidebar form to a database table\" ``` ### Step 4: Display products in the main dashboard When the user opens our app, products existing in the database must be shown automatically like below: Right below the “Tracked Products” text, we want to display each product’s name, its price, and two buttons for visiting and deleting the product. Let’s implement these features in `src/app.py`. 1. Import the `webbrowser` module: ```python # src/app.py ... # the rest of the imports import webbrowser ``` This module provides functions to open URLs in the default web browser, which we’ll use for the “Visit product” button. 2. Add a function to delete a product from the Products table: ```python def delete_product(product_id: str): \"\"\"Delete a product and all its competitors\"\"\" session = Session() product = session.query(Product).filter_by(id=product_id).first() if product: session.delete(product) session.commit() session.close() ``` The `delete_product` function takes a product ID as a string parameter and removes the corresponding product from the database. It first creates a new database session, then queries the Products table to find the product with the matching ID. If found, it deletes the product and commits the change to persist it. Finally, it closes the database session to free up resources. This function will be called when the user clicks the delete button for a specific product. 3. Add a function to display existing products with Streamlit `container` components: ```python def display_product_details(product): \"\"\"Display details for a single product\"\"\" st.subheader(product.name) cols = st.columns([1, 2]) with cols[0]: st.metric( label=\"Your Price\", value=f\"${product.your_price:.2f}\", ) with cols[1]: col1, col2 = st.columns(2) with col1: if product.url: st.button( \"Visit product\", key=f\"visit_btn_{product.id}\", use_container_width=True, on_click=lambda: webbrowser.open_new_tab(product.url), ) else: st.text(\"No URL provided\") with col2: st.button( \"🗑️ Delete\", key=f\"delete_btn_{product.id}\", type=\"primary\", use_container_width=True, on_click=lambda: delete_product(product.id), ) ``` The `display_product_details` function takes a product object as input and creates a nicely formatted display layout using Streamlit components. It shows the product name as a subheader and splits the display into two main columns. In the first column (1/3 width), it displays the product’s price using Streamlit’s metric component, which shows the price formatted with a dollar sign and 2 decimal places. The second column (2/3 width) is further divided into two equal sub-columns that contain action buttons: 1. A “Visit product” button that opens the product URL in a new browser tab (if a URL exists), otherwise displays “No URL provided”. 2. A “Delete” button with a trash can emoji that calls the `delete_product` function to remove the product from the database. The function uses Streamlit’s column layout system to create a responsive grid layout, and the buttons are configured to use the full width of their containers. Each button is given a unique key based on the product ID to ensure proper rendering. 4. Update the `main` function to use the `display_product_details` function when the app is loaded: ```python def main(): st.title(\"Competitor Price Monitor\") st.markdown( \"##### Compare your product prices to competitors' prices. Input your product details and competitors' URLs to get started.\" ) st.markdown(\"### Tracked Products\") st.markdown(\"---\") # Sidebar for adding new products with st.sidebar: st.header(\"Add New Product\") add_product() # Main content area session = Session() products = session.query(Product).all() if not products: st.info(\"No products added yet. Use the sidebar to add your first product.\") else: for product in products: with st.container(): display_product_details(product) session.close() ``` The updated main function adds several key improvements: The main content area now displays all tracked products in an organized way. It first queries the database to get all products, then handles two scenarios: - If no products exist, it shows a helpful message guiding users to add their first product - If products exist, it displays each one in its own container using the `display_product_details` function, which creates a consistent and professional layout for each product The function also properly manages database connections by creating a session at the start and ensuring it’s closed when done, following best practices for database handling. After this step, the fake products you added in the last step must be visible in the dashboard: Check to see if the buttons work (which they should!), then remove all fake products to verify that the app correctly displays a message when there are no products in the database. Then, commit the latest changes in your terminal: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Display existing products in the database\" ``` ### Step 5: Add a form to capture competing product URLs Now, the app must allow users to add any number of competing products to each product. To enable this functionality, we will add a small form to capture competing product URLs in each product container. Inside `src/app.py`, add this new function: ```python def add_competitor_form(product, session): \"\"\"Form to add a new competitor\"\"\" with st.expander(\"Add new competitor\", expanded=False): with st.form(f\"add_competitor_{product.id}\"): competitor_url = st.text_input(\"🔗 Competitor product URL\") col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1]) with col2: submit = st.form_submit_button( \"Add competitor\", use_container_width=True ) if submit: # TODO: Add competitor to the database st.success(\"Competitor added successfully!\") ``` The `add_competitor_form` function creates a collapsible form for each product that allows users to add competitor URLs. It takes a product and database session as parameters. Inside the form, it displays a text input field for the competitor’s URL and a submit button in a two-column layout. When submitted, it currently just shows a success message since the database functionality is not yet implemented. The form is hidden by default but can be expanded by clicking. Each form has a unique key based on the product ID to avoid conflicts when multiple products are displayed. To add the form to the app, update the `main` function again: ```python def main(): ... # The rest of the function if not products: st.info(\"No products added yet. Use the sidebar to add your first product.\") else: for product in products: with st.container(): display_product_details(product) add_competitor_form(product, session) session.close() ``` Here, we are adding a single line of code that calls the `add_competitor_form` function. After this change, the app must be looking like this: Capture the changes again with Git: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a form to capture competitor product URLs\" ``` ### Step 6: Scrape competitor product details When a user enters a competing product URL, the app must automatically scrape that products details like name, brand, and most importantly its price. Then, this information must be saved to a database, all under the hood. In this step, we will implement the scraping part using [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/). Firecrawl is an AI-powered scraping API that can automatically extract the information you need without relying on HTML and CSS selectors. So, you need to [sign up for a free Firecrawl account](https://firecrawl.dev/) for this step. After the sign up, you will be given an API key, which you should store as an environment variable in your `.env` file like below: ```bash POSTGRES_URL=\"YOUR-POSTGRES-URL\" FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-YOUR-FC-API-KEY\" ``` The next step is to add the following imports to `src/scraper.py`: ```python # src/scraper.py import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") from datetime import datetime from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() app = FirecrawlApp() ``` The imports above set up the scraping functionality: - `warnings` is used to suppress unnecessary warning messages - `datetime` for handling timestamps - `FirecrawlApp` class provides the AI-powered scraping capabilities - `BaseModel` and `Field` from `pydantic` for data validation - `load_dotenv` to load environment variables - The `FirecrawlApp` instance is initialized and ready to use Next, we create a new Pydantic model to specify the structure of scraped information about each competitor product: ```python # src/scraper.py class CompetitorProduct(BaseModel): \"\"\"Schema for extracting competitor product data\"\"\" name: str = Field(description=\"The name/title of the product\") price: float = Field(description=\"The current price of the product\") image_url: str | None = Field(None, description=\"URL of the main product image\") ``` Pydantic models are data validation classes that help define the structure and types of data you want to extract. When used with Firecrawl, they act as a schema that tells the AI what information to look for and extract from web pages. The `CompetitorProduct` model above defines three fields that we want to extract from competitor product pages: 1. `name`: A required string field for the product title/name 2. `price`: A required float field for the product’s price 3. `image_url`: An optional string field for the product’s main image URL The `Field` descriptions provide hints to Firecrawl’s AI about what each field represents, helping it accurately identify and extract the right information from diverse webpage layouts. This model will be used to automatically parse competitor product pages into a consistent format. Next, we define a function that performs the scraping process with Firecrawl: ```python def scrape_competitor_product(url: str) -> dict: \"\"\" Scrape product information from a competitor's webpage \"\"\" extracted_data = app.scrape_url( url, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": { \"schema\": CompetitorProduct.model_json_schema(), }, }, ) # Add timestamp to the extracted data data = extracted_data[\"extract\"] data[\"last_checked\"] = datetime.utcnow() return data ``` The `scrape_competitor_product` function takes a URL as input and uses Firecrawl’s AI-powered scraping capabilities to extract product information from competitor websites. Here’s how it works: 1. The function accepts a single parameter `url` which is the webpage to scrape 2. It calls Firecrawl’s `scrape_url` method with two key parameters: - `formats`: Specifies we want to use the “extract” format for structured data extraction - `extract`: Provides the `Pydantic` schema that defines what data to extract 3. The `CompetitorProduct` schema is converted to JSON format and passed as the extraction template 4. After scraping, it pulls out just the extracted data from the response 5. A timestamp is added to track when the price was checked 6. Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the product name, price, image URL and timestamp This function abstracts away the complexity of web scraping by using Firecrawl’s AI to automatically locate and extract the relevant product details, regardless of the website’s specific structure or layout. In the next step, we will capture the information returned by `scrape_competitor_product` to a database table. You can commit the changes now: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Create a function to scrape competitor product details\" ``` ### Step 7: Store competitor product details in the database When a user clicks the “Add competitor” button, the app must pass the entered URL to the `scrape_competitor_product` function. The function will scrape the competitor’s product details and passes them to a dedicated database table for competitor products. So, let’s create that table in `src/database.py`: ```python # Update the `Product` table to add a link to the `competitors` table class Product(Base): __tablename__ = \"products\" id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())) name = Column(String, nullable=False) your_price = Column(Float, nullable=False) url = Column(String) competitors = relationship( \"Competitor\", back_populates=\"product\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\" ) class Competitor(Base): __tablename__ = \"competitors\" id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())) product_id = Column(String, ForeignKey(\"products.id\")) url = Column(String, nullable=False) name = Column(String) current_price = Column(Float) last_checked = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow) image_url = Column(String) product = relationship(\"Product\", back_populates=\"competitors\") ``` The above code snippet first adds a new `competitors` attribute to the `Products` table. This creates a one-to-many relationship between products and competitors. It also creates a new `Competitor` table to store details about competitor products, including their URL, name, current price, last checked timestamp, and image URL. The relationship is set up with cascading deletes, so when a product is removed through the delete button in the UI, all its competitor entries are automatically deleted as well. Now, let’s piece together the `scrape_competitor_product` function from the last step and the database table in the UI so that `Add competitor` button works as expected. 1. Add the following imports to `src/app.py`: ```python import time from scraper import scrape_competitor_product from database import Competitor ``` 2. Replace the `add_competitor_form` function with this new version: ```python def add_competitor_form(product, session): \"\"\"Form to add a new competitor\"\"\" with st.expander(\"Add new competitor\", expanded=False): with st.form(f\"add_competitor_{product.id}\"): competitor_url = st.text_input(\"🔗 Competitor product URL\") col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1]) with col2: submit = st.form_submit_button( \"Add competitor\", use_container_width=True ) if submit: try: with st.spinner(\"Fetching competitor data...\"): data = scrape_competitor_product(competitor_url) competitor = Competitor( product_id=product.id, url=competitor_url, name=data[\"name\"], current_price=data[\"price\"], image_url=data.get(\"image_url\"), last_checked=data[\"last_checked\"], ) session.add(competitor) session.commit() st.success(\"✅ Competitor added successfully!\") # Refresh the page time.sleep(1) st.rerun() except Exception as e: st.error(f\"❌ Error adding competitor: {str(e)}\") ``` This new version of the add\\_competitor\\_form function adds several key improvements: 1. It adds error handling with `try/except` to gracefully handle scraping failures 2. It shows a loading spinner while scraping the competitor URL 3. It creates a proper Competitor database record linked to the product 4. It displays success/error messages to give feedback to the user 5. It automatically refreshes the page after adding a competitor using `st.rerun()` 6. It properly commits the new competitor to the database session The function now provides a much better user experience with visual feedback and proper error handling while integrating with both the scraper and database components. After making these changes, try adding a few fake competitors through the app. Any product link from Amazon, eBay, BestBuy or other e-commerce stores will work. Then, return to your terminal to commit the latest changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Link the Add competitor button to the database\" ``` ### Step 8: Display competitors for each product Now that the competitor form is working properly, we need to update the UI again so that existing competitors are shown below each product in our database. Here is our target layout after these changes are implemented: Looking at the screenshot, we can see several key changes to the product layout: 1. Each product now has a collapsible “View competitors” section that expands to show all tracked competitors 2. For each competitor, we display: - The competitor’s price (e.g. $799.99) - The price difference percentage compared to our price (e.g. -20.0%) - When the price was last checked (e.g. 2025-01-02 16:34) - A “Visit product” link to view the competitor’s page - A delete button to remove the competitor 3. The competitor prices are formatted with currency symbols and proper decimal places 4. The price difference is color-coded (red for higher prices, green for lower) 5. The “Add new competitor” section remains as an expandable form below the competitors list 6. Products with no competitors show a “No competitors added yet” message Let’s implement these UI improvements to match this new layout. First, add this single import statement to `src/app.py`: ```python from urllib.parse import urlparse ``` The `urlparse` function allows us to extract the domain of a URL. Next, let’s create a function that will later be linked to a button to delete a competitor: ```python # src/app.py def delete_competitor(competitor_id: str): \"\"\"Delete a competitor\"\"\" session = Session() competitor = session.query(Competitor).filter_by(id=competitor_id).first() if competitor: session.delete(competitor) session.commit() session.close() ``` The `delete_competitor` function takes a competitor ID as input and removes that competitor from the database. It opens a database session, queries for the competitor with the given ID, deletes it if found, commits the change, and closes the session. Next, create a function to display competitor details: ```python def display_competitor_metrics(product, comp): \"\"\"Display competitor price comparison metrics\"\"\" st.markdown(f\"#### {urlparse(comp.url).netloc}\") cols = st.columns([1, 2, 1, 1]) diff = ((comp.current_price - product.your_price) / product.your_price) * 100 with cols[0]: st.metric( label=\"💰 Competitor price\", value=f\"${comp.current_price:.2f}\", delta=f\"{diff:+.1f}%\", delta_color=\"normal\", ) with cols[1]: st.markdown(f\"**🕒 Checked:** {comp.last_checked.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}\") with cols[2]: st.button( \"Visit product\", key=f\"visit_btn_{comp.id}\", use_container_width=True, on_click=lambda: webbrowser.open_new_tab(comp.url), ) with cols[3]: st.button( \"🗑️\", key=f\"delete_comp_btn_{comp.id}\", type=\"primary\", use_container_width=True, on_click=lambda: delete_competitor(comp.id), ) ``` The `display_competitor_metrics` function is responsible for showing competitor price information in a structured layout using Streamlit components. Here’s what it does: 1. Takes two parameters: - `product`: The user’s product object containing price and details - `comp`: The competitor product object with pricing data 2. Creates a header showing the competitor’s domain name (extracted from their URL) 3. Sets up a 4-column layout to display: - Column 1: Shows the competitor’s price with a percentage difference from your price - Column 2: Shows when the price was last checked/updated - Column 3: Contains a button to visit the competitor’s product page - Column 4: Contains a delete button to remove this competitor 4. Calculates the price difference percentage between your price and competitor’s price 5. Uses Streamlit components: - `st.metric`: Displays the competitor price with the percentage difference - `st.markdown`: Shows the last checked timestamp - `st.button`: Creates interactive buttons for visiting and deleting 6. Integrates with other functions: - Uses `webbrowser.open_new_tab()` for the visit button - Calls `delete_competitor()` when delete button is clicked This function creates an interactive and informative UI element that helps users monitor and manage competitor pricing data effectively. Then, create another function to display all competitors using `display_competitor_metrics`: ```python def display_competitors(product): \"\"\"Display all competitors for a product\"\"\" if product.competitors: with st.expander(\"View competitors\", expanded=False): for comp in product.competitors: display_competitor_metrics(product, comp) else: st.info(\"No competitors added yet\") ``` The `display_competitors` function takes a product object as input and displays all competitors associated with that product. If the product has competitors, it creates an expandable section using Streamlit’s expander component. Inside this section, it iterates through each competitor and calls the `display_competitor_metrics` function to show detailed pricing information and controls for that competitor. If no competitors exist for the product, it shows an informational message indicating that no competitors have been added yet. Finally, let’s update the `main` function to use this last `display_competitors` function: ```python def main(): # ... the rest of the function if not products: st.info(\"No products added yet. Use the sidebar to add your first product.\") else: for product in products: with st.container(): display_product_details(product) display_competitors(product) # This line is new add_competitor_form(product, session) session.close() ``` Now, the app is almost ready! We just need to implement a feature to update competitor product prices regularly. Let’s tackle that in the last two sections. ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Display competitors for each product\" ``` ### Step 9: Write a script to update prices for all items Currently, once a competing product is added to our database, its details is never updated. Obviously, we have to fix this issue as websites regularly change product prices and run flash sales and discounts. That’s where the `src/check_prices.py` script comes into play. Once ready, it must rerun the scraper on all existing competing products in the database and fetch their latest details. Let’s start by making the following imports and setup: ```python import os from database import Base, Product, Competitor from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker from scraper import scrape_competitor_product from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() # Database setup engine = create_engine(os.getenv(\"POSTGRES_URL\")) Base.metadata.create_all(engine) Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) ``` Then, we create a single function called `update_competitor_prices`: ```python def update_competitor_prices(): \"\"\"Update all competitor prices\"\"\" session = Session() competitors = session.query(Competitor).all() for competitor in competitors: try: # Scrape updated data data = scrape_competitor_product(competitor.url) # Update competitor competitor.current_price = data[\"price\"] competitor.last_checked = data[\"last_checked\"] print(f\"Updated price for {competitor.name}: ${data['price']}\") except Exception as e: print(f\"Error updating {competitor.name}: {str(e)}\") session.commit() session.close() ``` The function iterates through all competitor products in the database and fetches their latest prices and details. For each competitor, it: 1. Makes a new web request to scrape the current price using `scrape_competitor_product` function 2. Updates the competitor record in the database with the new price and timestamp 3. Prints success/failure messages for monitoring 4. Commits all changes to persist the updates This allows us to keep our competitor price data fresh and track price changes over time. The function handles errors gracefully by catching and logging exceptions for any competitors that fail to update. Finally, we add the following code to the end of the script to allow running the script directly: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": update_competitor_prices() ``` Try testing the function and refreshing your local Streamlit instance to see the “Last checked” timestamp change for each competitor. Then, you can commit the changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Create a script to check all competitor prices\" ``` ### Step 10: Checking competitor prices regularly with GitHub Actions Now that we have a script to update competitor prices, we need to run it automatically every few hours. GitHub Actions is perfect for this task since it’s free and integrates well with our Git repository. First, you should create a new GitHub repository to push your code and then, add it as the remote origin: ```bash git add remote origin url-to-your-repo git push ``` Then, create a new `.github/workflows` directory structure in your project root: ```bash mkdir -p .github/workflows ``` The `.github/workflows` directory is where GitHub looks for workflow definition files. These files define automated tasks (called Actions) that GitHub can run for your repository. By creating this directory structure, we’re setting up the foundation for automated competitor price checking using GitHub Actions. > Note: if you are unfamiliar with GitHub Actions, check out our [deploying web scrapers tutorial](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/deploy-web-scrapers) to learn more about it. Next step is exporting our project dependencies to a standard `requirements.txt` file as GitHub Actions need it to create the correct virtual environment to execute `src/check_prices.py`: ```bash poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt ``` Then, create a new file at `.github/workflows/update-prices.yml` with the following contents: ```yaml name: Check competitor prices on: schedule: # Runs every 6 hours - cron: \"0 0,6,12,18 * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering jobs: check-prices: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: \"3.10\" cache: \"pip\" - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install -r requirements.txt - name: Run price checker env: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} POSTGRES_URL: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_URL }} run: python src/check_prices.py ``` This workflow does several things: 1. Runs automatically every 6 hours using a cron schedule 2. Can be triggered manually through GitHub’s UI 3. Sets up Python and Poetry 4. Installs project dependencies 5. Runs our price update script with the necessary environment variables To make this work, you need to add your environment variables as GitHub repository secrets: 1. Go to your GitHub repository 2. Click Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions 3. Click “New repository secret” 4. Add both `POSTGRES_URL` and `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` with their values After committing this file, GitHub Actions will start updating your competitor prices automatically every 6 hours UTC time: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow to update prices\" git push ``` You can monitor the workflow runs in the “Actions” tab of your GitHub repository. Each run will show you which competitor prices were successfully updated and any errors that occurred. That’s it! You now have a fully automated competitor price monitoring system. The app will keep track of your products, let you add competitors easily, and automatically update their prices every 6 hours using GitHub Actions. ### Limitations and Considerations When implementing this automated competitor price monitoring system, there are several important limitations and considerations to keep in mind: #### 1\\. Free Tier Restrictions - **GitHub Actions Minutes**: GitHub provides 2,000 minutes/month of free Actions runtime for public repositories. With our 6-hour schedule (4 runs daily), this averages around 120-240 minutes per month depending on script runtime. Monitor your usage to avoid exceeding limits. - **Firecrawl API Limits**: The free tier of Firecrawl has request limitations. Consider implementing retry logic and error handling for rate limit responses. #### 2\\. Legal Considerations - Always review and respect websites’ `robots.txt` files and Terms of Service - Some e-commerce sites explicitly prohibit automated price monitoring - Consider implementing delays between requests to avoid overwhelming target servers - Store only essential data to comply with data protection regulations #### 3\\. Data Accuracy - Price scraping can be affected by: - Regional pricing differences - Dynamic pricing systems - Special offers and discounts - Currency variations - Product variants/options #### 4\\. Technical Limitations - **Database Growth**: Regular price checks will continuously grow your database. Implement data retention policies or archiving strategies for older price records. - **Error Handling**: The current implementation provides basic error handling. In production, consider adding: ```python def scrape_competitor_product(url: str) -> dict: retries = 3 while retries > 0: try: # Existing scraping code except Exception as e: retries -= 1 if retries == 0: raise e time.sleep(5) # Wait before retry ``` - **Maintenance Requirements**: Regular monitoring is needed to ensure: - Database connection stability - API key validity - Scraping accuracy - GitHub Actions workflow status #### 5\\. Scaling Considerations - The current architecture may need modifications for scaling: - Consider implementing a queue system for large numbers of competitors - Add parallel processing for faster updates - Implement caching mechanisms - Consider database indexing and optimization #### 6\\. Monitoring and Alerting - The current implementation lacks comprehensive monitoring - Consider adding: - Scraping success/failure metrics - Database performance monitoring - API usage tracking - System health checks #### 7\\. Cost Implications for Scaling As your monitoring needs grow, consider the costs of: - Upgraded database plans - Additional GitHub Actions minutes - Premium API tiers - Monitoring tools - Error tracking services By understanding these limitations and planning accordingly, you can build a more robust and reliable price monitoring system that scales with your needs while staying within technical and legal boundaries. ## Conclusion In this tutorial, we’ve built a complete competitor price monitoring system that automatically tracks product prices across multiple e-commerce websites. Here’s what we accomplished: 1. Created a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit for managing products and competitors 2.

It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application. Some use cases for requests include Web Scraping, API integration, data retrieval from web services, automated testing of web applications, and sending data to remote servers. In this tutorial, we’ll cover several ways to install requests and demonstrate basic usage with some examples. ## Installing requests There are several ways to install requests depending on your needs and environment. ### Using pip The easiest way to install requests is using pip: ```bash python -m pip install requests ``` ### Using conda If you use the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can install requests using conda: ```bash conda install requests ``` ### Using a virtual environment It’s good practice to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your Python projects. You can install requests in a virtual environment like so: ```bash python -m venv myenv source myenv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate` pip install requests ``` ### From source You can also install requests from source by downloading the code from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/psf/requests) and running: ```bash python setup.py install ``` ## Troubleshooting If you encounter issues when trying to install requests, here are a few things to check: - Make sure you’re using a recent version of Python (3.6+). - If you’re using pip, make sure you’ve upgraded to the latest version with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. - If you’re using conda, make sure your Anaconda distribution is up-to-date. - Check that you have permissions to install packages on your system. You may need to use `sudo` or run your command shell as Administrator. If you’re still having trouble, consult the requests documentation or ask for help on the requests GitHub issues page. ## Usage Examples With requests installed, let’s look at a couple of basic usage examples. ### Making a Request Let’s make a basic GET request to the GitHub API: ```python import requests response = requests.get('https://api.github.com') print(response.status_code) # 200 print(response.text) # '{\"current_user_url\":\"https://api.github.com/user\",\"authorizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/authorizations\", ...}' ``` We can see the response status code is 200, indicating the request was successful. The response text contains the JSON data returned by the API. ### Web Scraping requests is commonly used for web scraping. Let’s try scraping the HTML from a Wikipedia page: ```python import requests url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping' response = requests.get(url) print(response.status_code) # 200 print(response.text) # # # # # Web scraping - Wikipedia # ... # # ``` We make a GET request to the Wikipedia article on web scraping and print out the complete HTML content of the page by accessing `response.text`. You can then use a library like BeautifulSoup to parse and extract information from this HTML. For more advanced web scraping needs, consider using a dedicated scraping service like [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/). Firecrawl handles the complexities of web scraping, including proxy rotation, JavaScript rendering, and avoiding detection, so you can focus on working with the data. Check out the [Python SDK](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python) here. ## References - Requests documentation: [https://requests.readthedocs.io/](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) - Requests GitHub repository: [https://github.com/psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) - BeautifulSoup documentation: [https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - Firecrawl web scraping service: [https://firecrawl.dev/](https://firecrawl.dev/) Article updated recently [🔥](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) ## Ready to _Build?_ Start scraping web data for your AI apps today.

When you are shipping fast, data is bound to get stale, with Firecrawl and LLMs you can make sure your public web data is always consistent! We will be using Opus’s huge 200k context window and Firecrawl’s parellization, making this process accurate and fast. ## Setup Install our python dependencies, including anthropic and firecrawl-py. ```bash pip install firecrawl-py anthropic ``` ## Getting your Claude and Firecrawl API Keys To use Claude Opus and Firecrawl, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your Anthropic API key from [here](https://www.anthropic.com/) and your Firecrawl API key from [here](https://firecrawl.dev/). ## Load website with Firecrawl To be able to get all the data from our website page put it into an easy to read format for the LLM, we will use [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/). It handles by-passing JS-blocked websites, extracting the main content, and outputting in a LLM-readable format for increased accuracy. Here is how we will scrape a website url using Firecrawl-py ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"YOUR-KEY\") crawl_result = app.crawl_url('mendable.ai', {'crawlerOptions': {'excludes': ['blog/.+','usecases/.+']}}) print(crawl_result) ``` With all of the web data we want scraped and in a clean format, we can move onto the next step. ## Combination and Generation Now that we have the website data, let’s pair up every page and run every combination through Opus for analysis. ```python from itertools import combinations page_combinations = [] for first_page, second_page in combinations(crawl_result, 2): combined_string = \"First Page:\\n\" + first_page['markdown'] + \"\\n\\nSecond Page:\\n\" + second_page['markdown'] page_combinations.append(combined_string) import anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"YOUR-KEY\", ) final_output = [] for page_combination in page_combinations: prompt = \"Here are two pages from a companies website, your job is to find any contradictions or differences in opinion between the two pages, this could be caused by outdated information or other. If you find any contradictions, list them out and provide a brief explanation of why they are contradictory or differing. Make sure the explanation is specific and concise. It is okay if you don't find any contradictions, just say 'No contradictions found' and nothing else. Here are the pages: \" + \"\\n\\n\".join(page_combination) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.0, system=\"You are an assistant that helps find contradictions or differences in opinion between pages in a company website and knowledge base. This could be caused by outdated information in the knowledge base.\", messages=[\\ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\\ ] ) final_output.append(message.content) ``` ## That’s about it! You have now built an agent that looks at your website and spots any inconsistencies it might have.

It initially relied on third-party services like Fetch and Playwright for data retrieval. However, these services often failed on certain sites or were too slow, causing issues for users. To address this, we built Fire Engine, now the default backend for Firecrawl. It’s designed to be more reliable and faster, solving the core problems we and our users encountered with other scraping services. ### What is Fire Engine? Fire Engine is a scraping primitive designed to increase Firecrawl’s scraping capabilities. We’re proud to say that Fire Engine outperforms leading competitors in key areas: - **Reliability:** 40% more reliable than scraping leading competitors when scraping different types of websites - **Speed:** Up to 33.17% faster than scraping leading competitors And this is just the beginning, we are working closely with Firecrawl users to further improve reliability, speed, and more. ### The Technology Behind Fire Engine Fire Engine combines a variety of browser and non-browser based techniques to balance speed and reliability, ensuring that you get data back without compromise. To do this, Fire engine has: - **Efficient Headless Browser Management:** Running browsers at scale is notoriously difficult, but Fire Engine handles this with ease. - **Persistent Browser Sessions:** By keeping browsers running, Fire Engine improves efficiency when handling new requests, reducing startup times and resource usage. - **Advanced Web Interaction Techniques:** Employing a sophisticated array of methods—including browser-based, browserless, and proprietary approaches - **Intelligent Request Handling:** From smart proxy selection to advanced queuing, every aspect of the request process is optimized for speed and reliability. With this technology, Fire Engine allows firecrawl to handle millions of requests daily with speed and accuracy. ### Try Fire Engine on Firecrawl Today Fire Engine powers Firecrawl to handle thousands of daily requests efficiently.

Just provide a query, and Firecrawl will explore the web, gather information, and synthesize key insights. It outputs a final analysis or whatever structed output you choose. * * * ## What Is Deep Research? Deep Research is a method of automatically performing multi-step, intelligent exploration across the web to uncover non-trivial insights about a topic. Unlike a simple search, it: - Breaks down complex queries into subtopics - Iteratively explores reliable content - Synthesizes findings into a cohesive report - Attributes every insight to a source Think of it as giving your app or workflow a dedicated research analyst—on demand. * * * ## Why an API? Research isn’t just for humans anymore. By offering Deep Research as an API, you can: - **Automate research** inside your own apps and workflows - **Scale insight generation** for any number of topics - **Build smarter features**: briefings, analysis bots, knowledge assistants, and more - **Control cost and speed** with tunable depth, time, and URL limits Firecrawl gives you the infrastructure to run intelligent research—without needing to build an AI pipeline from scratch. ## How it works Deep Research performs: 1. **Query analysis** to identify subtopics 2. **Iterative web exploration** across multiple sources 3. **Content synthesis** into digestible insights 4. **Source attribution** for traceability The result includes: - **Final Analysis**: A synthesized summary of findings - **Sources**: Curated list of relevant URLs - **Activities**: Timeline of research steps - **Progress**: Real-time tracking of depth & status * * * ## Example Usage **Python** ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp firecrawl = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"your_api_key\") params = { \"maxDepth\": 5, \"timeLimit\": 180, \"maxUrls\": 15 } def on_activity(activity): print(f\"[{activity['type']}] {activity['message']}\") results = firecrawl.deep_research( query=\"What are the latest developments in quantum computing?\", params=params, on_activity=on_activity ) print(f\"Final Analysis: {results['data']['finalAnalysis']}\") print(f\"Sources: {len(results['data']['sources'])} references\") ``` ## Sample response ```json { \"success\": true, \"status\": \"completed\", \"data\": { \"finalAnalysis\": \"Recent developments in quantum computing show significant progress in several key areas...\", \"activities\": [\\ {\\ \"type\": \"search\",\\ \"status\": \"completed\",\\ \"message\": \"Analyzing quantum computing breakthroughs in 2024\",\\ \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-15T10:30:00Z\",\\ \"depth\": 1\\ }\\ ], \"sources\": [\\ {\\ \"url\": \"https://example.com/quantum-computing-2024\",\\ \"title\": \"Latest Quantum Computing Breakthroughs\",\\ \"description\": \"Overview of recent advances in quantum computing technology\"\\ }\\ ] }, \"currentDepth\": 5, \"maxDepth\": 5 } ``` ### Structured Output Instead of receiving a markdown final analysis, you can customize the output with a structured output by setting the `formats` parameter to `json`. Set the `jsonOptions` parameter to specify the schema for the JSON output. This allows you to get a response format that is more specific to your use case. ### Customize even further You can also specify a `systemPrompt` and an `analysisPrompt` to customize the agentic process and the final analysis, respectively. ### Known Limitations (Alpha) - Research Scope Best suited for topics with publicly available information. May not access paywalled or private content. - Time Constraints Research jobs are limited to 10 minutes maximum to ensure reasonable response times. - Source Verification While sources are provided, manual verification of critical information is recommended. - Alpha State As an Alpha feature, the research methodology and output format may evolve based on feedback. * * * ## Documentation For API endpoints and other sdks, you can view the full documentation [here](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/alpha/deep-research).

Businesses can collect data from both internal and external sources. Internal sources include company websites, sales records, customer databases, and equipment sensors. When internal data isn’t enough, third-party data providers offer ready-to-use information for various needs. Popular data providers include [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) for financial data, [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/) for consumer behavior, and [Experian](https://www.experian.com/) for customer demographics. These providers offer clean, reliable data through simple subscriptions, though costs can be significant. For smaller businesses, alternatives like government open data portals, industry associations, and specialized data marketplaces offer more affordable options. When data isn’t readily available through providers, businesses often need to collect it themselves. Web scraping tools like [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) can automatically extract information from public websites, while [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) integrations enable direct access to external systems. Custom data collection scripts can monitor specific sources and gather information on a schedule. Some companies even use machine learning models to process unstructured data like images and text documents, converting them into structured datasets. For example, a company tracking competitor pricing might scrape e-commerce websites daily. Market researchers could use natural language processing to analyze social media posts and news articles. Manufacturing firms might set up [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) sensors to collect equipment performance data. The key is identifying valuable data sources and implementing appropriate collection methods. Regardless of which data sources and collection methods you choose, you’ll need robust systems to collect and manage the information effectively. This includes proper error handling, data validation, and storage infrastructure to ensure reliable operation at scale. ### Core Components of Data Collection Systems Modern data collection systems consist of several technical components working together. The collection layer includes APIs and web scrapers that gather data from sources like data providers, REST endpoints, databases, and websites. These components handle rate limiting, authentication, and error recovery. For example, a web scraper might use [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for JavaScript-heavy sites or [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (both Python libraries) for static HTML. The processing pipeline validates and transforms the collected data through ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. This includes data cleaning, format standardization, and integrity checks. Tools like [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) manage these workflow dependencies. Monitoring systems track success rates, latency, and data quality metrics, alerting teams when issues arise. The storage infrastructure typically combines different database types based on access patterns. Time-series databases like [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) handle sensor data, while document stores like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) suit unstructured content. A message queue system like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) helps decouple collection from processing, improving system reliability. Security measures include encryption, access controls, and audit logging to maintain data compliance. ### Types of Data That Can Be Automated Business data comes in three main formats that can be automatically collected. Organized data includes structured information like [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) CRM records (with clear fields for customer names, contact info, and purchase history) and financial databases that use standard formats like [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/). Unorganized data covers things like customer service chat logs, social media comments, and product reviews that need AI tools like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to extract useful information. Partially organized data falls in between, like website content that follows some patterns but isn’t fully structured. Some data needs to be processed right away for quick decisions. For example, stock trading systems need price updates within milliseconds, while factory sensors might need temperature readings every minute to prevent equipment damage. This real-time data requires special systems that can handle high-speed collection without delays or errors. Most businesses use message queues like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and in-memory databases like [Redis](https://redis.io/) to manage these fast-moving data streams reliably. The key is matching your collection method to your data type and timing needs. For instance, CRM data works well with API connections, while social media analysis might need AI-powered scrapers like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). Real-time systems cost more to build but deliver faster insights, while batch processing works fine for daily or weekly updates. ### Real-world Applications and Use Cases Different industries use automated data collection to solve specific business challenges. E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart continuously monitor competitor pricing across millions of products to optimize their own pricing strategies. Investment banks deploy sophisticated systems to aggregate real-time market data, news feeds, and social sentiment for algorithmic trading decisions. Manufacturing facilities use networks of IoT sensors to track equipment performance, predict maintenance needs, and prevent costly downtime. Healthcare providers leverage automated collection to gather patient data from electronic health records, wearable devices, and medical imaging systems, enabling better diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. Even traditional industries like agriculture have embraced automation, using satellite imagery and ground sensors to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and harvest timing. These examples demonstrate how automated data collection has become essential across sectors, driving innovation and competitive advantage. The key is selecting the right combination of tools and methods for your specific needs. ## Key Methods of Automated Data Collection Automated data collection can be implemented through various approaches, from fully programmatic solutions to no-code platforms. Programmatic methods using languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or [Java](https://www.java.com/) offer maximum flexibility and control, allowing developers to create custom scrapers, API integrations, and data processing pipelines. No-code platforms like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Make](https://www.make.com/) provide visual interfaces for connecting data sources and automating workflows without writing code, making automation accessible to business users. Hybrid approaches combining both methods are also common, where no-code tools handle simple tasks while custom code manages complex requirements. Enterprise solutions like [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/) and [Talend](https://www.talend.com/) offer comprehensive features but require significant investment. The choice depends on technical expertise, budget, and specific use cases. With that said, let’s discuss available options for your business’s specific needs. ### Web Scraping and Crawling Web scraping is a versatile way to automatically collect data from websites. Basic scraping tools like [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) can extract text and numbers from web pages, while more advanced tools like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) can handle complex layouts and gather images and documents. However, web scraping has limitations - websites can block scrapers, and site changes can break your collection process. Tools like [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) help address these challenges by adapting to website changes and handling dynamic content. ### Example: Modern Data Collection with Firecrawl While there are many tools available for automated data collection, let’s look at a practical example using Firecrawl, which demonstrates several key principles of modern data gathering. This example shows how to extract structured product information from Amazon: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from typing import Optional, List from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() # Define the data structure we want to collect class Product(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"Product name\") price: float = Field(description=\"Current price in USD\") description: Optional[str] = Field(description=\"Product description\") rating: Optional[float] = Field(description=\"Customer rating out of 5\") reviews_count: Optional[int] = Field(description=\"Number of customer reviews\") # Initialize the data collection tool app = FirecrawlApp() # Collect data from multiple product pages result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094DYPM88/\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Extract product information based on the schema provided.\", \"schema\": Product.model_json_schema(), }, ) # Process the results product = Product(**result[\"data\"]) print(f\"Product: {product.name}\") print(f\"Price: ${product.price}\") print(f\"Rating: {product.rating}/5 ({product.reviews_count} reviews)\") ``` ```plaintext Product: Razer Ergonomic Wrist Rest for Tenkeyless Keyboards: Plush Leatherette Memory Foam Cushion - Anti-Slip Rubber Feet Price: $19.99 Rating: 4.5/5 (9964 reviews) ``` The code above demonstrates a modern approach to web data collection using structured schemas and AI-powered extraction. By defining a Pydantic model, we specify exactly what product information we want to collect from Amazon pages - including the name, price, description, rating, and review count. The `FirecrawlApp` then uses this schema to intelligently identify and extract the relevant data without relying on brittle CSS selectors or XPath expressions. This approach offers several significant advantages over traditional web scraping methods. The schema-based collection using Pydantic ensures consistent data formats and built-in validation. The AI-powered extraction eliminates the need to maintain fragile selectors that break when websites change. The system can efficiently process multiple pages in parallel through the urls parameter, while providing robust error handling and automatic retry mechanisms. Additionally, it standardizes data formats automatically, converting prices, ratings, and other fields into appropriate data types. By shifting from traditional web scraping to intelligent data extraction, this method significantly reduces maintenance overhead while improving reliability. The structured approach makes it easier to adapt the collection process as websites evolve, while ensuring the extracted data maintains consistent quality and format. Firecrawl builds on these principles to provide a comprehensive scraping engine with capabilities beyond basic structured data extraction. To explore more features and use-cases, visit our [blog](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog) and [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction). ### Methods powered by ML & AI AI tools have made it possible to collect new types of data automatically. For example: - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) turn printed or handwritten text into digital text - Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) find important information in regular text, like names and dates - Speech recognition systems like [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) turn recorded speech into text While these AI methods work well in ideal conditions, real-world results can vary. Factors like image quality, background noise, and handwriting style affect accuracy. Most organizations pair AI tools with human review to ensure data quality. ### API Integrations APIs let you collect data directly from other systems and services. Many companies provide APIs to access their data, including social media platforms, financial services, and weather services. APIs are generally more reliable than web scraping since they provide consistent data formats and clear documentation. However, they often have usage limits and can be expensive for large amounts of data. ### IoT Sensors and Devices Internet of Things (IoT) devices automatically collect data from the physical world. Common examples include: - Temperature and humidity sensors in warehouses - Machine performance monitors in factories - Medical devices that track patient vital signs - Environmental sensors that measure air and water quality The main challenge with IoT devices is managing the large volume of data they generate. Organizations need robust systems to store and analyze the constant stream of sensor readings. ### Form Automation Form automation helps collect data from digital forms and surveys more efficiently. These tools like [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/) and [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) can: - Automatically save form responses - Check that submitted information is valid - Send data to the right storage systems - Work well on mobile devices While form automation saves time, the quality of collected data still depends on how well the forms are designed and whether people fill them out correctly. ## Essential Features of Data Collection Systems When implementing automated data collection, several key features are essential for building a reliable and efficient system. Let’s explore each of these critical components in detail. ### Scheduling Capabilities Every reliable data collection system needs robust scheduling features. Basic scheduling allows for daily or weekly data collection, while advanced systems can respond to specific triggers or events. The key is to match collection frequency with business needs - collecting too often wastes resources, while collecting too rarely risks missing important data. Popular scheduling tools include [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for complex workflows, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for simple automation, and [Windows Task Scheduler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page) for basic needs. Modern scheduling should include retry mechanisms for failed attempts and the ability to handle different time zones. The system should also avoid overwhelming data sources with too many requests by implementing proper delays and rate limiting. ### Data Validation and Cleaning Data validation acts as a quality control checkpoint. Effective systems check for common issues like missing values, incorrect formats, and duplicate entries. Validation rules should match business requirements - for example, ensuring phone numbers follow the correct format or prices fall within reasonable ranges. Tools like [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) and [Pandas Profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/) help automate validation checks. The cleaning process transforms raw data into a consistent, usable format using tools like [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) or Python’s [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. This includes standardizing dates, removing extra spaces, fixing common typos, and converting units where necessary. Good cleaning processes document all changes made to the original data, allowing teams to trace any issues back to their source. ### Storage and Export Options Data storage needs careful planning to balance accessibility with security. Modern systems typically use databases for structured data and file systems for documents and media. Popular options include [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for relational data, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for flexible storage, and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for files. The storage solution should scale with growing data volumes while maintaining quick access to frequently used information. Export capabilities should support common formats like CSV, JSON, and Excel, making it easy to share data with other business tools. Tools like [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) and [Talend Open Studio](https://www.talend.com/products/talend-open-studio/) help manage data movement. The system should also maintain proper backup procedures and allow for easy data recovery when needed. ### Error Handling and Monitoring Robust error handling prevents small issues from becoming major problems. The system should detect common failures like network timeouts, invalid responses, and authentication errors. Tools like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) and [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) help catch and report errors. More importantly, it should respond appropriately - either by retrying the operation, alerting technical staff, or following pre-defined fallback procedures. For monitoring, popular choices include [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualizations and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics collection. Monitoring tools should track key metrics like collection success rates, processing times, and storage usage. Good monitoring includes alerts for potential problems and detailed logs for troubleshooting. Dashboard views help teams quickly understand system health and identify areas needing attention. ### Compliance and Security Features Data collection systems must include security features that protect sensitive information. Basic requirements include encryption for data in transit and at rest, secure authentication for system access, and detailed audit logs of who accessed what data and when. Tools like [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) help manage secrets and encryption keys, while [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) provides robust authentication. Compliance features vary by industry and region. Healthcare systems need [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) compliance, while systems collecting European customer data must follow [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) requirements. Tools like [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/) and [BigID](https://bigid.com/) help manage compliance requirements. The key is understanding which regulations apply to your data and implementing appropriate controls. This might include data anonymization, retention policies, and mechanisms for handling user privacy requests. ## Implementation Process After understanding these essential features, let’s explore the process of implementing an automated data collection system. ### Planning Your Data Collection Strategy Before implementing any data collection system, organizations must clearly define their goals and requirements. For example, an e-commerce platform might need to track orders, inventory levels, and customer feedback - each representing different types of data collection challenges that require careful planning. This initial assessment helps identify not just what data is needed, but also its sources, formats, and collection frequencies. A thorough evaluation of technical requirements and available resources follows the initial planning. This includes assessing existing systems, staff capabilities, and budget constraints. For instance, while the e-commerce platform might have developers familiar with basic automation, they may need additional training for handling real-time data streams or implementing advanced validation rules. The planning phase should also account for future growth and scalability needs. Organizations need to estimate how their data volumes might increase over time and what additional types of data they might need to collect in the future. This forward-thinking approach helps avoid choosing solutions that might become bottlenecks as operations expand. ### Selecting the Right Tools Tool selection requires balancing functionality, ease of use, and long-term maintenance requirements. While open-source solutions might appear cost-effective initially, they often demand more technical expertise and internal support. Commercial tools typically offer better documentation and support but come with ongoing license costs that need careful consideration. Consider how tools will integrate with existing systems and workflows. An e-commerce platform might choose a data collection tool that integrates well with their current shopping cart software, but this tool should also work effectively with other data sources like marketing analytics or customer support systems. The goal is to select tools that fit into the broader technology ecosystem while meeting specific collection needs. When evaluating options, start with a pilot project using simpler tools before committing to enterprise-level solutions. This approach allows organizations to test assumptions and identify potential issues early, when they’re easier and less expensive to address. The pilot phase also helps teams gain valuable experience with data collection processes and requirements. ### Setting Up Automation Workflows Implementation should begin with simple, well-defined processes that have clear success metrics. For instance, start by automating the collection of daily operational data before moving on to more complex real-time collection needs. This incremental approach helps teams build confidence and expertise while minimizing risks. Each workflow requires thorough documentation covering the data source, collection schedule, validation rules, and storage requirements. Take an e-commerce platform’s order collection process - the documentation should detail how order data is extracted, what validation checks ensure data quality, and where the processed data is stored. This documentation becomes crucial as systems grow more complex and team members change. Error handling and monitoring procedures need to be established from the start. This includes defining how the system should respond to common issues like network timeouts or invalid data, and setting up appropriate notification systems. Clear procedures help maintain system reliability and make troubleshooting more efficient when issues arise. ### Quality Assurance and Testing A comprehensive testing strategy should cover both normal operations and edge cases. Testing needs to verify that the system handles common scenarios correctly while also checking its response to unusual situations like partial data availability or system outages. For example, test how the system handles both standard data inputs and edge cases like malformed records or unexpected data volumes. Setting up a separate testing environment that mirrors the production setup allows teams to safely verify changes before implementation. This environment should include sample data that represents real-world scenarios while maintaining data privacy and security requirements. Regular testing helps ensure that collection processes remain reliable as systems evolve. Quality checks should compare collected data against source data to verify accuracy and completeness. These checks help identify any discrepancies early and maintain data quality over time. Regular audits of collected data help ensure that the system continues to meet business requirements and maintains high data quality standards. ### Scaling Considerations As data collection needs grow, systems often face new challenges in storage, processing speed, and data management. Organizations need to plan for these challenges by choosing scalable technologies and building flexible systems that can adapt to changing requirements. For example, an e-commerce platform might need to evolve from batch processing to real-time data collection as transaction volumes increase. Storage and processing strategies often need adjustment as data volumes grow. This might include implementing data archiving for historical information, optimizing frequently accessed data, and adjusting collection frequencies to balance timeliness with system performance. Regular monitoring of system resources helps identify potential bottlenecks before they impact operations. Scaling isn’t just about handling larger data volumes - it also involves maintaining system reliability and performance as complexity increases. Organizations need to consider factors like data retention policies, backup strategies, and disaster recovery procedures. Regular review and updates of these procedures help ensure that the system continues to meet business needs as it grows. ## Conclusion Automated data collection represents a fundamental shift in how organizations gather and process information. While the initial setup requires careful planning and resource investment, the long-term benefits of reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, and faster data processing make it an essential tool for modern businesses. The key to success lies in choosing the right combination of methods and tools that match specific business needs while maintaining data quality and security.

For example, buying a discounted item we don’t need isn’t saving money at all - it’s falling for one of the oldest sales tactics. However, there are legitimate cases where waiting for a price drop on items you actually need makes perfect sense. The challenge is that e-commerce websites run flash sales and temporary discounts constantly, but these deals often disappear as quickly as they appear. Missing these brief windows of opportunity can be frustrating. That’s where automation comes in. In this guide, we’ll build a Python application that monitors product prices across any e-commerce website and instantly notifies you when prices drop on items you’re actually interested in. Here is a sneak peek of the app: The app has a simple appearance but provides complete functionality: - It has a minimalistic UI to add or remove products from the tracker - A simple dashboard to display price history for each product - Controls for setting the price drop threshold in percentages - A notification system that sends Discord alerts when a tracked item’s price drops - A scheduling system that updates the product prices on an interval you specify - Runs for free for as long as you want Even though the title says “Amazon price tracker” (full disclosure: I was forced to write that for SEO purposes), the app will work for any e-commerce website you can imagine (except Ebay, for some reason). So, let’s get started building this Amazon price tracker. ## The Toolstack We Will Use The app will be built using Python and these libraries:: - [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) for the UI - [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) for AI-based scraping of e-commerce websites - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database management In addition to Python, we will use these platforms: - Discord for notifications - GitHub for hosting the app - GitHub Actions for running the app on a schedule - Supabase for hosting a free Postgres database instance ## Building an Amazon Price Tracker App Step-by-step Since this project involves multiple components working together, we’ll take a top-down approach rather than building individual pieces first. This approach makes it easier to understand how everything fits together, since we’ll introduce each tool only when it’s needed. The benefits of this strategy will become clear as we progress through the tutorial. ### Step 1: Setting up the environment First, let’s create a dedicated environment on our machines to work on the project: ```bash mkdir automated-price-tracker cd automated-price-tracker python -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate ``` These commands create a working directory and activate a virtual environment. Next, create a new script called `ui.py` for designing the user interface with Streamlit. ```bash touch ui.py ``` Then, install Streamlit: ```bash pip install streamlit ``` Next, create a `requirements.txt` file and add Streamlit as the first dependency: ```bash touch requirements.txt echo \"streamlit\\n\" >> requirements.txt ``` Since the code will be hosted on GitHub, we need to initialize Git and create a `.gitignore` file: ```bash git init touch .gitignore echo \".venv\" >> .gitignore # Add the virtual env folder git commit -m \"Initial commit\" ``` ### Step 2: Add a sidebar to the UI for product input Let’s take a look at the final product one more time: It has two sections: the sidebar and the main dashboard. Since the first thing you do when launching this app is adding products, we will start building the sidebar first. Open `ui.py` and paste the following code: ```python import streamlit as st # Set up sidebar with st.sidebar: st.title(\"Add New Product\") product_url = st.text_input(\"Product URL\") add_button = st.button(\"Add Product\") # Main content st.title(\"Price Tracker Dashboard\") st.markdown(\"## Tracked Products\") ``` The code snippet above sets up a basic Streamlit web application with two main sections. In the sidebar, it creates a form for adding new products with a text input field for the product URL and an “Add Product” button. The main content area contains a dashboard title and a section header for tracked products. The code uses Streamlit’s `st.sidebar` context manager to create the sidebar layout and basic Streamlit components like `st.title`, `st.text_input`, and `st.button` to build the user interface elements. To see how this app looks like, run the following command: ```bash streamlit run ui.py ``` Now, let’s add a commit to save our progress: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a sidebar to the basic UI\" ``` ### Step 3: Add a feature to check if input URL is valid In the next step, we want to add some restrictions to the input field like checking if the passed URL is valid. For this, create a new file called `utils.py` where we write additional utility functions for our app: ```bash touch utils.py ``` Inside the script, paste following code: ```bash # utils.py from urllib.parse import urlparse import re def is_valid_url(url: str) -> bool: try: # Parse the URL result = urlparse(url) # Check if scheme and netloc are present if not all([result.scheme, result.netloc]): return False # Check if scheme is http or https if result.scheme not in [\"http\", \"https\"]: return False # Basic regex pattern for domain validation domain_pattern = ( r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$\" ) if not re.match(domain_pattern, result.netloc): return False return True except Exception: return False ``` The above function `is_valid_url()` validates URLs by checking several criteria: 1. It verifies the URL has both a scheme ( `http`/ `https`) and domain name 2. It ensures the scheme is specifically `http` or `https` 3. It validates the domain name format using regex to check for valid characters and TLD 4. It returns True only if all checks pass, False otherwise Let’s use this function in our `ui.py` file. Here is the modified code: ```python import streamlit as st from utils import is_valid_url # Set up sidebar with st.sidebar: st.title(\"Add New Product\") product_url = st.text_input(\"Product URL\") add_button = st.button(\"Add Product\") if add_button: if not product_url: st.error(\"Please enter a product URL\") elif not is_valid_url(product_url): st.error(\"Please enter a valid URL\") else: st.success(\"Product is now being tracked!\") # Main content ... ``` Here is what’s new: 1. We added URL validation using the `is_valid_url()` function from `utils.py` 2. When the button is clicked, we perform validation: - Check if URL is empty - Validate URL format using `is_valid_url()` 3. User feedback is provided through error/success messages: - Error shown for empty URL - Error shown for invalid URL format - Success message when URL passes validation Rerun the Streamlit app again and see if our validation works. Then, return to your terminal to commit the changes we’ve made: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a feature to check URL validity\" ``` ### Step 4: Scrape the input URL for product details When a valid URL is entered and the add button is clicked, we need to implement product scraping functionality instead of just showing a success message. The system should: 1. Immediately scrape the product URL to extract key details: - Product name - Current price - Main product image - Brand name - Other relevant attributes 2. Store these details in a database to enable: - Regular price monitoring - Historical price tracking - Price change alerts - Product status updates For the scraper, we will use [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/), an AI-based scraping API for extracting webpage data without HTML parsing. This solution provides several advantages: 1. No website HTML code analysis required for element selection 2. Resilient to HTML structure changes through AI-based element detection 3. Universal compatibility with product webpages due to structure-agnostic approach 4. Reliable website blocker bypass via robust API infrastructure First, create a new file called `scraper.py`: ```bash touch scraper.py ``` Then, install these three libraries: ```bash pip install firecrawl-py pydantic python-dotenv echo \"firecrawl-py\\npydantic\\npython-dotenv\\n\" >> requirements.txt # Add them to dependencies ``` `firecrawl-py` is the Python SDK for Firecrawl scraping engine, `pydantic` is a data validation library that helps enforce data types and structure through Python class definitions, and `python-dotenv` is a library that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your Python application. With that said, head over to the Firecrawl website and [sign up for a free account](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) (the free plan will work fine). You will be given an API key, which you should copy. Then, create a `.env` file in your terminal and add the API key as an environment variable: ```bash touch .env echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' >> .env\" echo \".env\" >> .gitignore # Ignore .env files in Git ``` The `.env` file is used to securely store sensitive configuration values like API keys that shouldn’t be committed to version control. By storing the Firecrawl API key in `.env` and adding it to `.gitignore`, we ensure it stays private while still being accessible to our application code. This is a security best practice to avoid exposing credentials in source control. Now, we can start writing the `scraper.py`: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from dotenv import load_dotenv from datetime import datetime load_dotenv() app = FirecrawlApp() ``` Here, `load_dotenv()` function reads the `.env` file you have in your working directory and loads the environment variables inside, including the Firecrawl API key. When you create an instance of `FirecrawlApp` class, the API key is automatically detected to establish a connection between your script and the scraping engine in the form of the `app` variable. Now, we create a Pydantic class (usually called a model) that defines the details we want to scrape from each product: ```python class Product(BaseModel): \"\"\"Schema for creating a new product\"\"\" url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the product\") name: str = Field(description=\"The product name/title\") price: float = Field(description=\"The current price of the product\") currency: str = Field(description=\"Currency code (USD, EUR, etc)\") main_image_url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the main image of the product\") ``` Pydantic models may be completely new to you, so let’s break down the `Product` model: - The `url` field stores the product page URL we want to track - The `name` field stores the product title/name that will be scraped - The `price` field stores the current price as a float number - The `currency` field stores the 3-letter currency code (e.g. USD, EUR) - The `main_image_url` field stores the URL of the product’s main image Each field is typed and has a description that documents its purpose. The `Field` class from Pydantic allows us to add metadata like descriptions to each field. These descriptions are especially important for Firecrawl since it uses them to automatically locate the relevant HTML elements containing the data we want. Now, let’s create a function to call the engine to scrape URL’s based on the schema above: ```python def scrape_product(url: str): extracted_data = app.scrape_url( url, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": {\"schema\": Product.model_json_schema()}, }, ) # Add the scraping date to the extracted data extracted_data[\"extract\"][\"timestamp\"] = datetime.utcnow() return extracted_data[\"extract\"] if __name__ == \"__main__\": product = \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U21ZZK/\" print(scrape_product(product)) ``` The code above defines a function called `scrape_product` that takes a URL as input and uses it to scrape product information. Here’s how it works: The function calls `app.scrape_url` with two parameters: 1. The product URL to scrape 2. A params dictionary that configures the scraping: - It specifies we want to use the “extract” format - It provides our `Product` Pydantic model schema as the extraction template as a JSON object The scraper will attempt to find and extract data that matches our Product schema fields - the URL, name, price, currency, and image URL. The function returns just the “extract” portion of the scraped data, which contains the structured product information. `extract` returns a dictionary to which we add the date of the scraping as it will be important later on. Let’s test the script by running it: ```bash python scraper.py ``` You should get an output like this: ```python { 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U21ZZK', 'name': 'MOVA Globe Earth with Clouds 4.5\"', 'price': 212, 'currency': 'USD', 'main_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/blog/price-tracking/I/41bQ3Y58y3L._AC_.jpg', 'timestamp': '2024-12-05 13-20' } ``` The output shows that a [MOVA Globe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U21ZZK) costs $212 USD on Amazon at the time of writing this article. You can test the script for any other website that contains the information we are looking (except Ebay): - Price - Product name/title - Main image URL One key advantage of using Firecrawl is that it returns data in a consistent dictionary format across all websites. Unlike HTML-based scrapers like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy which require custom code for each site and can break when website layouts change, Firecrawl uses AI to understand and extract the requested data fields regardless of the underlying HTML structure. Finish this step by committing the new changes to Git: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Implement a Firecrawl scraper for products\" ``` ### Step 5: Storing new products in a PostgreSQL database If we want to check product prices regularly, we need to have an online database. In this case, Postgres is the best option since it’s reliable, scalable, and has great support for storing time-series data like price histories. There are many platforms for hosting Postgres instances but the one I find the easiest and fastest to set up is Supabase. So, please head over to [the Supabase website](https://supabase.com/) and create your free account. During the sign-up process, you will be given a password, which you should save somewhere safe on your machine. Then, in a few minutes, your free Postgres instance comes online. To connect to this instance, click on Home in the left sidebar and then, “Connect”: You will be shown your database connection string with a placeholder for the password you copied. You should paste this string in your `.env` file with your password added to the `.env` file: ```bash echo POSTGRES_URL=\"THE-SUPABASE-URL-STRING-WITH-YOUR-PASSWORD-ADDED\" ``` Now, the easiest way to interact with this database is through SQLAlchemy. Let’s install it: ```bash pip install \"sqlalchemy==2.0.35\" psycopg2-binary echo \"psycopg2-binary\\nsqlalchemy==2.0.35\\n\" >> requirements.txt ``` > Note: [SQLAlchemy](https://sqlalchemy.org/) is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that lets us interact with databases using Python code instead of raw SQL. For our price tracking project, it provides essential features like database connection management, schema definition through Python classes, and efficient querying capabilities. This makes it much easier to store and retrieve product information and price histories in our Postgres database. After the installation, create a new `database.py` file for storing database-related functions: ```bash touch database.py ``` Let’s populate this script: ```python from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship, declarative_base from datetime import datetime Base = declarative_base() class Product(Base): __tablename__ = \"products\" url = Column(String, primary_key=True) prices = relationship( \"PriceHistory\", back_populates=\"product\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\" ) class PriceHistory(Base): __tablename__ = \"price_histories\" id = Column(String, primary_key=True) product_url = Column(String, ForeignKey(\"products.url\")) name = Column(String, nullable=False) price = Column(Float, nullable=False) currency = Column(String, nullable=False) main_image_url = Column(String) timestamp = Column(DateTime, nullable=False) product = relationship(\"Product\", back_populates=\"prices\") ``` The code above defines two SQLAlchemy models for our price tracking database: The `Product` model acts as a registry of all items we want to track. It’s kept simple with just the URL as we don’t want to duplicate data that changes over time. The `PriceHistory` model stores the actual price data points and product details at specific moments in time. This separation allows us to: - Track how product details (name, price, image) change over time - Maintain a clean historical record for each product - Efficiently query price trends without loading unnecessary data Each record in `PriceHistory` contains: - A unique ID as primary key - The product URL as a foreign key linking to the `Product` - The product name - The price value and currency - The main product image URL - A timestamp of when the price was recorded The relationship between `Product` and `PriceHistory` is bidirectional, allowing easy navigation between related records. The `cascade` setting ensures price histories are deleted when their product is deleted. These models provide the structure for storing and querying our price tracking data in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy’s ORM capabilities. Now, we define a `Database` class with a singe `add_product` method: ```python class Database: def __init__(self, connection_string): self.engine = create_engine(connection_string) Base.metadata.create_all(self.engine) self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine) def add_product(self, url): session = self.Session() try: # Create the product entry product = Product(url=url) session.merge(product) # merge will update if exists, insert if not session.commit() finally: session.close() ``` The `Database` class above provides core functionality for managing product data in our PostgreSQL database. It takes a connection string in its constructor to establish the database connection using SQLAlchemy. The `add_product` method allows us to store new product URLs in the database. It uses SQLAlchemy’s `merge` functionality which intelligently handles both inserting new products and updating existing ones, preventing duplicate entries. The method carefully manages database sessions, ensuring proper resource cleanup by using `try`/ `finally` blocks. This prevents resource leaks and maintains database connection stability. Let’s use this method inside the sidebar of our UI. Switch to `ui.py` and make the following adjustments: First, update the imports to load the Database class and initialize it: ```python import os import streamlit as st from utils import is_valid_url from database import Database from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() with st.spinner(\"Loading database...\"): db = Database(os.getenv(\"POSTGRES_URL\")) ``` The code integrates the `Database` class into the Streamlit UI by importing required dependencies and establishing a database connection. The database URL is loaded securely from environment variables using `python-dotenv`. The `Database` class creates or updates the tables we specified in `database.py` after being initialized. The database initialization process is wrapped in a Streamlit spinner component to maintain responsiveness while establishing the connection. This provides visual feedback during the connection setup period, which typically requires a brief initialization time. Then, in the sidebar code, we only need to add a single line of code to add the product to the database if the URL is valid: ```python # Set up sidebar with st.sidebar: st.title(\"Add New Product\") product_url = st.text_input(\"Product URL\") add_button = st.button(\"Add Product\") if add_button: if not product_url: st.error(\"Please enter a product URL\") elif not is_valid_url(product_url): st.error(\"Please enter a valid URL\") else: db.add_product(product_url) # This is the new line st.success(\"Product is now being tracked!\") ``` In the final `else` block that runs when the product URL is valid, we call the `add_product` method to store the product in the database. Let’s commit everything: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a Postgres database integration for tracking product URLs\" ``` ### Step 6: Storing price histories for new products Now, after the product is added to the `products` table, we want to add its details and its scraped price to the `price_histories` table. First, switch to `database.py` and add a new method for creating entries in the `PriceHistories` table: ```python class Database: ... # the rest of the class def add_price(self, product_data): session = self.Session() try: price_history = PriceHistory( id=f\"{product_data['url']}_{product_data['timestamp']}\", product_url=product_data[\"url\"], name=product_data[\"name\"], price=product_data[\"price\"], currency=product_data[\"currency\"], main_image_url=product_data[\"main_image_url\"], timestamp=product_data[\"timestamp\"], ) session.add(price_history) session.commit() finally: session.close() ``` The `add_price` method takes a dictionary containing product data (which is returned by our scraper) and creates a new entry in the `PriceHistory` table. The entry’s ID is generated by combining the product URL with a timestamp. The method stores essential product information like name, price, currency, image URL, and the timestamp of when the price was recorded. It uses SQLAlchemy’s session management to safely commit the new price history entry to the database. Now, we need to add this functionality to the sidebar as well. In `ui.py`, add a new import statement that loads the `scrape_product` function from `scraper.py`: ```python ... # The rest of the imports from scraper import scrape_product ``` Then, update the `else` block in the sidebar again: ```python with st.sidebar: st.title(\"Add New Product\") product_url = st.text_input(\"Product URL\") add_button = st.button(\"Add Product\") if add_button: if not product_url: st.error(\"Please enter a product URL\") elif not is_valid_url(product_url): st.error(\"Please enter a valid URL\") else: db.add_product(product_url) with st.spinner(\"Added product to database. Scraping product data...\"): product_data = scrape_product(product_url) db.add_price(product_data) st.success(\"Product is now being tracked!\") ``` Now when a user enters a product URL and clicks the “Add Product” button, several things happen: 1. The URL is validated to ensure it’s not empty and is properly formatted. 2. If valid, the URL is added to the products table via `add_product()`. 3. The product page is scraped immediately to get current price data. 4. This initial price data is stored in the price history table via `add_price()`. 5. The user sees loading spinners and success messages throughout the process. This gives us a complete workflow for adding new products to track, including capturing their initial price point. The UI provides clear feedback at each step and handles errors gracefully. Check that everything is working the way we want it and then, commit the new changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a feature to track product prices after they are added\" ``` ### Step 7: Displaying each product’s price history in the main dashboard Let’s take a look at the final product shown in the introduction once again: Apart from the sidebar, the main dashboard shows each product’s price history visualized with a Plotly line plot where the X axis is the timestamp while the Y axis is the prices. Each line plot is wrapped in a Streamlit component that includes buttons for removing the product from the database or visiting its source URL. In this step, we will implement the plotting feature and leave the two buttons for a later section. First, add a new method to the `Database` class for retrieving the price history for each product: ```python class Database: ... # The rest of the code def get_price_history(self, url): \"\"\"Get price history for a product\"\"\" session = self.Session() try: return ( session.query(PriceHistory) .filter(PriceHistory.product_url == url) .order_by(PriceHistory.timestamp.desc()) .all() ) finally: session.close() ``` The method queries the price histories table based on product URL, orders the rows in descending order (oldest first) and returns the results. Then, add another method for retrieving all products from the `products` table: ```python class Database: ... def get_all_products(self): session = self.Session() try: return session.query(Product).all() finally: session.close() ``` The idea is that every time our Streamlit app is opened, the main dashboard queries all existing products from the database and render their price histories with line charts in dedicated components. To create the line charts, we need Plotly and Pandas, so install them in your environment: ```bash pip install pandas plotly echo \"pandas\\nplotly\\n\" >> requirements.txt ``` Afterward, import them at the top of `ui.py` along with other existing imports: ```python import pandas as pd import plotly.express as px ``` Then, switch to `ui.py` and paste the following snippet of code after the Main content section: ```python # Main content st.title(\"Price Tracker Dashboard\") st.markdown(\"## Tracked Products\") # Get all products products = db.get_all_products() ``` Here, after the page title and subtitle is shown, we are retrieving all products from the database. Let’s loop over them: ```python # Create a card for each product for product in products: price_history = db.get_price_history(product.url) if price_history: # Create DataFrame for plotting df = pd.DataFrame( [\\ {\"timestamp\": ph.timestamp, \"price\": ph.price, \"name\": ph.name}\\ for ph in price_history\\ ] ) ``` For each product, we get their price history with `db.get_price_history` and then, convert this data into a dataframe with three columns: - Timestamp - Price - Product name This makes plotting easier with Plotly. Next, we create a Streamlit expander component for each product: ```python # Create a card for each product for product in products: price_history = db.get_price_history(product.url) if price_history: ... # Create a card-like container for each product with st.expander(df[\"name\"][0], expanded=False): st.markdown(\"---\") col1, col2 = st.columns([1, 3]) with col1: if price_history[0].main_image_url: st.image(price_history[0].main_image_url, width=200) st.metric( label=\"Current Price\", value=f\"{price_history[0].price} {price_history[0].currency}\", ) ``` The expander shows the product name as its title and contains: 1. A divider line 2. Two columns: - Left column: Product image (if available) and current price metric - Right column (shown in next section) The price is displayed using Streamlit’s metric component which shows the current price and currency. Here is the rest of the code: ```python ... with col2: # Create price history plot fig = px.line( df, x=\"timestamp\", y=\"price\", title=None, ) fig.update_layout( xaxis_title=None, yaxis_title=\"Price\", showlegend=False, margin=dict(l=0, r=0, t=0, b=0), height=300, ) fig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\", tickangle=45) fig.update_yaxes(tickprefix=f\"{price_history[0].currency} \", tickformat=\".2f\") st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True) ``` In the right column, we create an interactive line plot using Plotly Express to visualize the price history over time. The plot shows price on the y-axis and timestamp on the x-axis. The layout is customized to remove the title, adjust axis labels and formatting, and optimize the display size. The timestamps are formatted to show date and time, with angled labels for better readability. Prices are displayed with 2 decimal places and a dollar sign prefix. The plot is rendered using Streamlit’s `plotly_chart` component and automatically adjusts its width to fill the container. After this step, the UI must be fully functional and ready to track products. For example, here is what mine looks like after adding a couple of products: But notice how the price history chart doesn’t show anything. That’s because we haven’t populated it by checking the product price in regular intervals. Let’s do that in the next couple of steps. For now, commit the latest changes we’ve made: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Display product price histories for each product in the dashboard\" ``` * * * Let’s take a brief moment to summarize the steps we took so far and what’s next. So far, we’ve built a Streamlit interface that allows users to add product URLs and displays their current prices and basic information. We’ve implemented the database schema, created functions to scrape product data, and designed a clean UI with price history visualization. The next step is to set up automated price checking to populate our history charts and enable proper price tracking over time. ### Step 8: Adding new price entries for existing products Now, we want to write a script that adds new price entries in the `price_histories` table for each product in `products` table. We call this script `check_prices.py`: ```python import os from database import Database from dotenv import load_dotenv from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from scraper import scrape_product load_dotenv() db = Database(os.getenv(\"POSTGRES_URL\")) app = FirecrawlApp() ``` At the top, we are importing the functions and packages and initializing the database and a Firecrawl app. Then, we define a simple `check_prices` function: ```python def check_prices(): products = db.get_all_products() for product in products: try: updated_product = scrape_product(product.url) db.add_price(updated_product) print(f\"Added new price entry for {updated_product['name']}\") except Exception as e: print(f\"Error processing {product.url}: {e}\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": check_prices() ``` In the function body, we retrieve all products URLs, retrieve their new price data with `scrape_product` function from `scraper.py` and then, add a new price entry for the product with `db.add_price`. If you run the function once and refresh the Streamlit app, you must see a line chart appear for each product you are tracking: Let’s commit the changes in this step: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a script for checking prices of existing products\" ``` ### Step 9: Check prices regularly with GitHub actions GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate various software workflows directly from your GitHub repository. In our case, it’s particularly useful because we can set up automated price checks to run the `check_prices.py` script at regular intervals (e.g., daily or hourly) without manual intervention. This ensures we consistently track price changes and maintain an up-to-date database of historical prices for our tracked products. So, the first step is creating a new GitHub repository for our project and pushing existing code to it: ```bash git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/price-tracker.git git push origin main ``` Then, return to your terminal and create this directory structure: ```bash mkdir -p .github/workflows touch .github/workflows/check_prices.yml ``` The first command creates a new directory structure `.github/workflows` using the `-p` flag to create parent directories if they don’t exist. The second command creates an empty YAML file called `check_prices.yml` inside the workflows directory. GitHub Actions looks for workflow files in this specific location - any YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory will be automatically detected and processed as workflow configurations. These YAML files define when and how your automated tasks should run, what environment they need, and what commands to execute. In our case, this file will contain instructions for GitHub Actions to periodically run our price checking script. Let’s write it: ```yaml name: Price Check on: schedule: # Runs every 3 minutes - cron: \"*/3 * * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering ``` Let’s break down this first part of the YAML file: The `name: Price Check` line gives our workflow a descriptive name that will appear in the GitHub Actions interface. The `on:` section defines when this workflow should be triggered. We’ve configured two triggers: 1. A schedule using cron syntax `*/3 * * * *` which runs the workflow every 3 minutes. The five asterisks represent minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week respectively. The `*/3` means “every 3rd minute”. The 3-minute interval is for debugging purposes, we will need to choose a wider interval later on to respect the free limits of GitHub actions. 2. `workflow_dispatch` enables manual triggering of the workflow through the GitHub Actions UI, which is useful for testing or running the check on-demand. Now, let’s add the rest: ```yaml jobs: check-prices: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: \"3.10\" cache: \"pip\" - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install -r requirements.txt - name: Run price checker env: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} POSTGRES_URL: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_URL }} run: python check_prices.py ``` Let’s break down this second part of the YAML file: The `jobs:` section defines the actual work to be performed. We have one job named `check-prices` that runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine ( `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`). Under `steps:`, we define the sequence of actions: 1. First, we checkout our repository code using the standard `actions/checkout@v4` action 2. Then we set up Python 3.10 using `actions/setup-python@v5`, enabling pip caching to speed up dependency installation 3. Next, we install our Python dependencies by upgrading `pip` and installing requirements from our `requirements.txt` file. At this point, it is essential that you were keeping a complete dependency file based on the installs we made in the project. 4. Finally, we run our price checker script, providing two environment variables: - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: For accessing the web scraping service - `POSTGRES_URL`: For connecting to our database Both variables must be stored in our GitHub repository as secrets for this workflow file to run without errors. So, navigate to the repository you’ve created for the project and open its Settings. Under “Secrets and variables” > “Actions”, click on “New repository secret” button to add the environment variables we have in the `.env` file one-by-one. Then, return to your terminal, commit the changes and push: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a workflow to check prices regularly\" git push origin main ``` Next, navigate to your GitHub repository again and click on the “Actions” tab: From there, you can run the workflow manually (click “Run workflow” and refresh the page). If it is executed successfully, you can return to the Streamlit app and refresh to see the new price added to the chart. ### Step 10: Setting up Discord for notifications Now that we know our scheduling workflow works, the first order of business is setting a wider check interval in the workflow file. Even though our first workflow run was manually, the rest happen automatically. ```bash on: schedule: # Runs every 6 hours - cron: \"0 0,6,12,18 * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering ``` The cron syntax `0 0,6,12,18 * * *` can be broken down as follows: - First `0`: Run at minute 0 - `0,6,12,18`: Run at hours 0 (midnight), 6 AM, 12 PM (noon), and 6 PM - First `*`: Run every day of the month - Second `*`: Run every month - Third `*`: Run every day of the week So this schedule will check prices four times daily: at midnight, 6 AM, noon, and 6 PM (UTC time). This spacing helps stay within GitHub Actions’ free tier limits while still catching most price changes. Now, commit and push the changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Set a wider check interval in the workflow file\" git push origin main ``` Now comes the interesting part. Each time the workflow is run, we want to compare the current price of the product to its original price when we started tracking it. If the difference between these two prices exceeds a certain threshold like 5%, this means there is a discount happening for the product and we want to send a notification. The easiest way to set this up is by using Discord webhooks. So, if you don’t have one already, go to Discord.com and create a new account (optionally, download the desktop app as well). Then, setting up Discord notifications requires a few careful steps: 1. **Create a discord server** - Click the ”+” button in the bottom-left corner of Discord - Choose “Create My Own” → “For me and my friends” - Give your server a name (e.g., “Price Alerts”) 2. **Create a channel for alerts** - Your server comes with a #general channel by default - You can use this or create a new channel called #price-alerts - Right-click the channel you want to use 3. **Set up the webhook** - Select “Edit Channel” from the right-click menu - Go to the “Integrations” tab - Click “Create Webhook” - Give it a name like “Price Alert Bot” - The webhook URL will be generated automatically - Click “Copy Webhook URL” - this is your unique notification endpoint 4. **Secure the webhook URL** - Never share or commit your webhook URL directly - Add it to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Add it to your GitHub repository secrets - The URL should look something like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...` This webhook will serve as a secure endpoint that our price tracker can use to send notifications directly to your Discord channel. Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps to other apps in real-time. They work like a notification system - when something happens in one app, it automatically sends data to another app through a unique URL. In our case, we’ll use Discord webhooks to automatically notify us when there’s a price drop. Whenever our price tracking script detects a significant discount, it will send a message to our Discord channel through the webhook URL, ensuring we never miss a good deal. After copying the webhook URL, you should save it as environment variable to your `.env` file: ```python echo \"DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL='THE-URL-YOU-COPIED'\" >> .env ``` Now, create a new file called `notifications.py` and paste the following contents: ```python from dotenv import load_dotenv import os import aiohttp import asyncio load_dotenv() async def send_price_alert( product_name: str, old_price: float, new_price: float, url: str ): \"\"\"Send a price drop alert to Discord\"\"\" drop_percentage = ((old_price - new_price) / old_price) * 100 message = { \"embeds\": [\\ {\\ \"title\": \"Price Drop Alert! 🎉\",\\ \"description\": f\"**{product_name}**\\nPrice dropped by {drop_percentage:.1f}%!\\n\"\\ f\"Old price: ${old_price:.2f}\\n\"\\ f\"New price: ${new_price:.2f}\\n\"\\ f\"[View Product]({url})\",\\ \"color\": 3066993,\\ }\\ ] } try: async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session: await session.post(os.getenv(\"DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL\"), json=message) except Exception as e: print(f\"Error sending Discord notification: {e}\") ``` The `send_price_alert` function above is responsible for sending price drop notifications to Discord using webhooks. Let’s break down what’s new: 1. The function takes 4 parameters: - `product_name`: The name of the product that dropped in price - `old_price`: The previous price before the drop - `new_price`: The current lower price - `url`: Link to view the product 2. It calculates the percentage drop in price using the formula: `((old_price - new_price) / old_price) * 100` 3. The notification is formatted as a Discord embed - a rich message format that includes: - A title with a celebration emoji - A description showing the product name, price drop percentage, old and new prices - A link to view the product - A green color (3066993 in decimal) 4. The message is sent asynchronously using `aiohttp` to post to the Discord webhook URL stored in the environment variables 5. Error handling is included to catch and print any issues that occur during the HTTP request This provides a clean way to notify users through Discord whenever we detect a price drop for tracked products. To check the notification system works, add this main block to the end of the script: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(send_price_alert(\"Test Product\", 100, 90, \"https://www.google.com\")) ``` `asyncio.run()` is used here because `send_price_alert` is an async function that needs to be executed in an event loop. `asyncio.run()` creates and manages this event loop, allowing the async HTTP request to be made properly. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to use the `await` keyword inside `send_price_alert`. To run the script, install `aiohttp`: ```python pip install aiohttp echo \"aiohttp\\n\" >> requirements.txt python notifications.py ``` If all is well, you should get a Discord message in your server that looks like this: Let’s commit the changes we have: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Set up Discord alert system\" ``` Also, don’t forget to add the Discord webhook URL to your GitHub repository secrets! ### Step 11: Sending Discord alerts when prices drop Now, the only step left is adding a price comparison logic to `check_prices.py`. In other words, we want to use the `send_price_alert` function if the new scraped price is lower than the original. This requires a revamped `check_prices.py` script: ```python import os import asyncio from database import Database from dotenv import load_dotenv from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from scraper import scrape_product from notifications import send_price_alert load_dotenv() db = Database(os.getenv(\"POSTGRES_URL\")) app = FirecrawlApp() # Threshold percentage for price drop alerts (e.g., 5% = 0.05) PRICE_DROP_THRESHOLD = 0.05 async def check_prices(): products = db.get_all_products() product_urls = set(product.url for product in products) for product_url in product_urls: # Get the price history price_history = db.get_price_history(product_url) if not price_history: continue # Get the earliest recorded price earliest_price = price_history[-1].price # Retrieve updated product data updated_product = scrape_product(product_url) current_price = updated_product[\"price\"] # Add the price to the database db.add_price(updated_product) print(f\"Added new price entry for {updated_product['name']}\") # Check if price dropped below threshold if earliest_price > 0: # Avoid division by zero price_drop = (earliest_price - current_price) / earliest_price if price_drop >= PRICE_DROP_THRESHOLD: await send_price_alert( updated_product[\"name\"], earliest_price, current_price, product_url ) if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(check_prices()) ``` Let’s examine the key changes in this enhanced version of `check_prices.py`: 1. New imports and setup - Added `asyncio` for `async`/ `await` support - Imported `send_price_alert` from `notifications.py` - Defined `PRICE_DROP_THRESHOLD = 0.05` (5% threshold for alerts) 2. Async function conversion - Converted `check_prices()` to async function - Gets unique product URLs using set comprehension to avoid duplicates 3. Price history analysis - Retrieves full price history for each product - Gets `earliest_price` from `history[-1]` (works because we ordered by timestamp DESC) - Skips products with no price history using `continue` 4. Price drop detection logic - Calculates drop percentage: `(earliest_price - current_price) / earliest_price` - Checks if drop exceeds 5% threshold - Sends Discord alert if threshold exceeded using `await send_price_alert()` 5. Async main block - Uses `asyncio.run()` to execute async `check_prices()` in event loop When I tested this new version of the script, I immediately got an alert: Before we supercharge our workflow with the new notification system, you should add this line of code to your `check_prices.yml` workflow file to read the Discord webhook URL from your GitHub secrets: ```python ... - name: Run price checker env: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} POSTGRES_URL: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_URL }} DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }} run: python automated_price_tracking/check_prices.py ``` Finally, let’s commit everything and push to GitHub so that our workflow is supercharged with our notification system: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add notification system to price drops\" git push origin main ``` ## Limitations of Free Tier Tools Used in the Tutorial Before wrapping up, let’s quickly review the limitations of the free tools we used in this tutorial: - GitHub Actions: Limited to 2,000 minutes per month for free accounts. Consider increasing the cron interval to stay within limits. - Supabase: Free tier includes 500MB database storage and limited row count. Monitor usage if tracking many products. - Firecrawl: Free API tier allows 500 requests per month. This means that at 6 hour intervals, you can track up to four products in the free plan. - Streamlit Cloud: Free hosting tier has some memory/compute restrictions and goes to sleep after inactivity. While these limitations exist, they’re quite generous for personal use and learning. The app will work well for tracking a reasonable number of products with daily price checks. ## Conclusion and Next Steps Congratulations for making it to the end of this extremely long tutorial! We’ve just covered how to implement an end-to-end Python project you can proudly showcase on your portfolio. We built a complete price tracking system that scrapes product data from e-commerce websites, stores it in a Postgres database, analyzes price histories, and sends automated Discord notifications when prices drop significantly. Along the way, we learned about web scraping with Firecrawl, database management with SQLAlchemy, asynchronous programming with asyncio, building interactive UIs with Streamlit, automating with GitHub actions and integrating external webhooks. However, the project is far from perfect. Since we took a top-down approach to building this app, our project code is scattered across multiple files and often doesn’t follow programming best practices. For this reason, I’ve recreated the same project in a much more sophisticated manner with production-level features. [This new version on GitHub](https://github.com/BexTuychiev/automated-price-tracking) implements proper database session management, faster operations and overall smoother user experience. Also, this version includes buttons for removing products from the database and visiting them through the app. If you decide to stick with the basic version, you can find the full project code and notebook in the official Firecrawl GitHub repository’s example projects. I also recommend that you [deploy your Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) so that you have a functional app accessible everywhere you go. Here are some further improvements you might consider for the app: - Improve the price comparison logic: the app compares the current price to the oldest recorded price, which might not be ideal. You may want to compare against recent price trends instead. - No handling of currency conversion if products use different currencies. - The Discord notification system doesn’t handle rate limits or potential webhook failures gracefully. - No error handling for Firecrawl scraper - what happens if the scraping fails? - No consistent usage of logging to help track issues in production. - No input URL sanitization before scraping. Some of these features are implemented in [the advanced version of the project](https://github.com/BexTuychiev/automated-price-tracking), so definitely check it out!

This powerful combination allows developers to build low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences that can fetch and interact with live web content on the fly. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the process of integrating Firecrawl’s scraping and mapping tools into the OpenAI Realtime API Console Demo. By the end, you’ll have a real-time conversational agent capable of talking with any website. ### Prerequisites Before you begin, make sure you have the following: - **Node.js and npm** installed on your machine. - An **OpenAI API key** with access to the Realtime API. - A **Firecrawl API key**. - Basic understanding of **React** and **TypeScript**. ### Step 1: Clone the OpenAI Realtime API Console Demo First, clone the repository that contains the OpenAI Realtime API Console Demo integrated with Firecrawl. ```bash git clone https://github.com/nickscamara/firecrawl-openai-realtime.git cd firecrawl-openai-realtime ``` ### Step 2: Install Dependencies Install the required npm packages: ```bash npm install ``` ### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI and Firecrawl API keys: ```env OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-firecrawl-api-key ``` If you’re running a local relay server, set the relay server URL: ```env REACT_APP_LOCAL_RELAY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8081 ``` ### Step 4: Integrate Firecrawl Tools into the Realtime API Console Demo Open the `ConsolePage.tsx` file located at `src/pages/ConsolePage.tsx`. #### Import Firecrawl At the top of the file, import the Firecrawl SDK: ```typescript import FirecrawlApp from \"@mendable/firecrawl-js\"; ``` #### Add the ‘scrape\\_data’ Tool Within the `useEffect` hook where tools are added to the client, add the `scrape_data` tool: ```typescript client.addTool( { name: \"scrape_data\", description: \"Goes to or scrapes data from a given URL using Firecrawl.\", parameters: { type: \"object\", properties: { url: { type: \"string\", description: \"URL to scrape data from\", }, }, required: [\"url\"], }, }, async ({ url }: { url: string }) => { const firecrawl = new FirecrawlApp({ apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY || \"\", }); const data = await firecrawl.scrapeUrl(url, { formats: [\"markdown\", \"screenshot\"], }); if (!data.success) { return \"Failed to scrape data from the given URL.\"; } setScreenshot(data.screenshot || \"\"); return data.markdown; }, ); ``` This tool allows the assistant to scrape data from any URL using Firecrawl. #### Add the ‘map\\_website’ Tool Next, add the `map_website` tool to enable searching for pages with specific keywords on a website: ```typescript client.addTool( { name: \"map_website\", description: \"Searches a website for pages containing specific keywords using Firecrawl.\", parameters: { type: \"object\", properties: { url: { type: \"string\", description: \"URL of the website to search\", }, search: { type: \"string\", description: \"Keywords to search for (2-3 max)\", }, }, required: [\"url\", \"search\"], }, }, async ({ url, search }: { url: string; search: string }) => { const firecrawl = new FirecrawlApp({ apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY || \"\", }); const mapData = await firecrawl.mapUrl(url, { search }); if (!mapData.success || !mapData.links?.length) { return \"No pages found with the specified keywords.\"; } const topLink = mapData.links[0]; const scrapeData = await firecrawl.scrapeUrl(topLink, { formats: [\"markdown\", \"screenshot\"], }); if (!scrapeData.success) { return \"Failed to retrieve data from the found page.\"; } setScreenshot(scrapeData.screenshot || \"\"); return scrapeData.markdown; }, ); ``` This tool allows the assistant to search a website for specific content and retrieve it. #### Manage Screenshot State At the top of your `ConsolePage` component, add state management for the screenshot: ```typescript const [screenshot, setScreenshot] = useState(\"\"); ``` #### Display the Screenshot in the UI In the UI, display the screenshot by adding the following within the appropriate JSX: ```jsx { screenshot && ; } ``` ### Step 5: Run the Application In a new terminal window, start the React application: ```bash npm start ``` Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with your real-time conversational agent. ### Testing the Agent Now, you can test your agent by initiating a conversation. For example, ask: **User**: “Can you get the latest blog post from [https://mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai/)?” The assistant will use the `scrape_data` tool to fetch content from the specified URL and present it to you. ### Conclusion By integrating Firecrawl’s scraping and mapping tools into the OpenAI Realtime API Console Demo, you’ve created a powerful conversational agent capable of interacting with any website in real time. This setup opens up endless possibilities for building advanced AI applications that can access and process live web content on demand. ### References - [OpenAI Realtime API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) - [Firecrawl Node SDK](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/node) - [OpenAI Realtime API Console Demo with Firecrawl](https://github.com/nickscamara/firecrawl-openai-realtime) - [Firecrawl Official Website](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) Article updated recently [🔥](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) ## Ready to _Build?_ Start scraping web data for your AI apps today.

When I first started learning programming in 2020, I found that web scraping is one of the coolest things you can do in code. Finding a stubborn website, spending hours in browser’s developer tools to test XPath queries, using Python’s BeautifulSoup to detect elements with HTML/Selectors, writing pagination logic… those were the days. Fast-forward to today, I don’t think anybody is doing those things anymore. The AI hype caught up with web scraping tools as well. Today, instead of manual scraping, developers simply open up their favorite AI scraper and just tell it what they need to extract like “Scrape all capes and masks to turn my cat into Batman from this ecommerce website”. So what exactly makes AI scraping different? At its core, AI-powered web scraping uses machine learning models or language to understand webpage content the way humans do. Instead of relying on brittle selectors that break whenever a site updates its layout, AI systems can identify what you’re looking for based on context and meaning. These tools can navigate complex sites, handle JavaScript-heavy pages, bypass CAPTCHA challenges, and even extract data from non-standard formats. The best part? You don’t need to write a single line of XPath or understand CSS selectors anymore. Just describe what you want in plain English, and the AI figures out how to get it. This shift has transformed days of coding into minutes of prompting. With numerous AI-powered scraping solutions available in 2025, finding the right tool for your specific needs matters more than ever. Let’s explore the market leaders that are setting the standard in this rapidly evolving space. ## Leading AI Web Scraping Solutions ### Firecrawl: The Best Choice After evaluating numerous AI-powered web scraping solutions, Firecrawl ( [https://firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev/)) consistently stands out as the most comprehensive option. With over 500 upvotes on Product Hunt, it’s clear that developers have recognized its exceptional capabilities. What makes Firecrawl particularly impressive is its advanced JavaScript extraction capabilities. When scraping modern web applications where content loads dynamically, this becomes essential rather than optional. The platform’s robust anti-bot countermeasures ensure your scrapers continue running even on sites with sophisticated protection mechanisms, while integrated proxy management handles IP rotation automatically. One feature I’ve found particularly valuable is Firecrawl’s real-time adaptation for dynamic data. Websites change constantly, and having a tool that adjusts on the fly saves countless hours of maintenance. The developer-friendly API makes integration straightforward with clean documentation and predictable behavior. For those wanting to test Firecrawl without any setup, [extract.chat](https://www.extract.chat/) provides an intuitive interface where you can simply describe what you want scraped in natural language. The versatility of Firecrawl becomes apparent when examining its supported tasks. Beyond basic scraping, it converts webpages to structured markdown, crawls entire websites, captures screenshots, and even downloads massive sites into single text files for LLM processing. The deep research endpoint and structured content extraction with Pydantic models demonstrate its utility for sophisticated data gathering operations. Here’s a glimpse of how straightforward the code implementation can be: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field # Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key') class ExtractSchema(BaseModel): company_mission: str supports_sso: bool is_open_source: bool is_in_yc: bool data = app.scrape_url('https://docs.firecrawl.dev/', { 'formats': ['json'], 'jsonOptions': { 'schema': ExtractSchema.model_json_schema(), } }) print(data[\"json\"]) ``` The code example demonstrates Firecrawl’s key advantage: using Pydantic models to define extraction schemas. This approach focuses on what data you need rather than how to extract it, making the code more intuitive and maintainable.

Introduction Web scraping has become an essential tool for gathering data from the internet. Whether you’re tracking prices, collecting news articles, or building a research dataset, Python offers several popular libraries to help you extract information from websites. Two of the most widely used tools are BeautifulSoup4 (BS4) and Scrapy, each with its own strengths and ideal use cases. Choosing between BS4 and Scrapy isn’t always straightforward. BS4 is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it perfect for beginners and small projects. Scrapy, on the other hand, offers powerful features for large-scale scraping but comes with a steeper learning curve. Making the right choice can save you time and prevent headaches down the road. In this guide, we’ll compare BS4 and Scrapy in detail, looking at their features, performance, and best uses. We’ll also explore practical examples and discuss modern alternatives that solve common scraping challenges. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of which tool best fits your needs and how to get started with web scraping in Python. ## Prerequisites Before diving into the comparison, make sure you have: - Basic knowledge of Python programming - Understanding of HTML structure and CSS selectors - Python 3.7+ installed on your system - Familiarity with command line interface - A code editor or IDE of your choice You’ll also need to install the required libraries: ```bash pip install beautifulsoup4 scrapy firecrawl-py pydantic python-dotenv ``` ## 2\\. Understanding BeautifulSoup4 BeautifulSoup4, often called BS4, is a Python library that helps developers extract data from HTML and XML files. Think of it as a tool that can read and understand web pages the same way your browser does, but instead of showing you the content, it helps you collect specific information from it. BS4 works by turning messy HTML code into a well-organized structure that’s easy to navigate and search through. The library shines in its simplicity. With just a few lines of code, you can pull out specific parts of a webpage like headlines, prices, or product descriptions. Here’s a quick example: ```python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests # Get a webpage response = requests.get('https://news.ycombinator.com') soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # Find all article titles titles = soup.find_all('span', class_='titleline') for idx, title in enumerate(titles): print(f\"{idx + 1}. {title.text.strip()}\") if idx == 4: break ``` This code demonstrates BeautifulSoup4’s straightforward approach to web scraping. It fetches the Hacker News homepage using the requests library, then creates a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML. The `find_all()` method searches for `` elements with the class `\"titleline\"`, which contain article titles. The code loops through the first 5 titles, printing each one with its index number. The `strip()` method removes any extra whitespace around the titles. The output shows real article titles from Hacker News, demonstrating how BS4 can easily extract specific content from a webpage: ```out 1. The GTA III port for the Dreamcast has been released (gitlab.com/skmp) 2. Arnis: Generate Cities in Minecraft from OpenStreetMap (github.com/louis-e) 3. Things we learned about LLMs in 2024 (simonwillison.net) 4. Journey from Entrepreneur to Employee (akshay.co) 5. Systems ideas that sound good but almost never work (learningbyshipping.com) ``` While BS4 excels at handling static websites, it does have limitations. It can’t process JavaScript-generated content, which many modern websites use. It also doesn’t handle tasks like managing multiple requests or storing data. However, these limitations are often outweighed by its gentle learning curve and excellent documentation, making it an ideal starting point for anyone new to web scraping. Key Features: - Simple, intuitive API for parsing HTML/XML - Powerful searching and filtering methods - Forgiving HTML parser that can handle messy code - Extensive documentation with clear examples - Small memory footprint - Compatible with multiple parsers ( `lxml`, `html5lib`) ## 3\\. Understanding Scrapy Source: [Scrapy documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html). Scrapy takes a different approach to web scraping by providing a complete framework rather than just a parsing library. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for web scraping – it includes everything you need to crawl websites, process data, and handle common scraping challenges all in one package. While this makes it more powerful than BS4, it also means there’s more to learn before you can get started. Here’s a basic example of how Scrapy works: ```python # hackernews_spider.py import scrapy class HackerNewsSpider(scrapy.Spider): name = \"hackernews\" start_urls = [\"https://news.ycombinator.com\"] def parse(self, response): # Get all stories for story in response.css(\"span.titleline\"): # Extract story title yield {\"title\": story.css(\"a::text\").get()} # Go to next page if available # if next_page := response.css('a.morelink::attr(href)').get(): # yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse) # To run the spider, we need to use the Scrapy command line # scrapy runspider hackernews_spider.py -o results.json ``` This code defines a simple Scrapy spider that crawls Hacker News. The spider starts at the homepage, extracts story titles from each page, and could optionally follow pagination links (currently commented out). The spider uses CSS selectors to find and extract content, demonstrating Scrapy’s built-in parsing capabilities. The results can be exported to JSON using Scrapy’s command line interface. What sets Scrapy apart is its architecture. Instead of making one request at a time like BS4, Scrapy can handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it much faster for large projects. It also includes built-in features that you’d otherwise need to build yourself. Scrapy’s key components include: Spider middleware for customizing request/response handling, item pipelines for processing and storing data, and automatic request queuing and scheduling. It provides built-in support for exporting data in formats like JSON, CSV, and XML. The framework also includes robust error handling with retry mechanisms and a command-line interface for project management. ## 4\\. Head-to-Head Comparison Let’s break down how BS4 and Scrapy compare in key areas that matter most for web scraping projects. ### Performance When it comes to speed and efficiency, Scrapy has a clear advantage. Its ability to handle multiple requests at once means it can scrape hundreds of pages while BS4 is still working on its first dozen. Think of BS4 as a solo worker, carefully processing one page at a time, while Scrapy is like a team of workers tackling many pages simultaneously. Memory usage tells a similar story. BS4 is lightweight and uses minimal memory for single pages, making it perfect for small projects. However, Scrapy’s smart memory management shines when dealing with large websites, efficiently handling thousands of pages without slowing down your computer. ### Ease of Use BS4 takes the lead in simplicity. You can start scraping with just 4-5 lines of code and basic Python knowledge. Here’s a quick comparison: BS4: ```python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests response = requests.get(\"https://example.com\") soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"html.parser\") titles = soup.find_all(\"h1\") ``` Scrapy: ```python import scrapy class MySpider(scrapy.Spider): name = 'myspider' start_urls = ['https://example.com'] def parse(self, response): titles = response.css('h1::text').getall() yield {'titles': titles} # Requires additional setup and command-line usage as seen above ``` ### Features Here’s a simple breakdown of key features: | Feature | BeautifulSoup4 | Scrapy | | --- | --- | --- | | JavaScript Support | ❌ | ❌ (needs add-ons) | | Multiple Requests | ❌ (manual) | ✅ (automatic) | | Data Processing | ❌ (basic) | ✅ (built-in pipelines) | | Error Handling | ❌ (manual) | ✅ (automatic retries) | | Proxy Support | ❌ (manual) | ✅ (built-in) | ### Use Cases Choose BS4 when: - You’re new to web scraping - You need to scrape a few simple pages - You want to quickly test or prototype - The website is mostly static HTML - You’re working within a larger project Choose Scrapy when: - You need to scrape thousands of pages - You want built-in data processing - You need advanced features like proxy rotation - You’re building a production scraper - Performance is critical ## 5\\. Common Challenges and Limitations Web scraping tools face several hurdles that can make data extraction difficult or unreliable. Understanding these challenges helps you choose the right tool and prepare for potential roadblocks. ### Dynamic Content Modern websites often load content using JavaScript after the initial page load. Neither BS4 nor Scrapy can handle this directly. While you can add tools like Selenium or Playwright to either solution, this makes your scraper more complex and slower. A typical example is an infinite scroll page on social media – the content isn’t in the HTML until you scroll down. ### Anti-Bot Measures Websites are getting smarter at detecting and blocking scrapers. Common protection methods include: - CAPTCHAs and reCAPTCHA challenges - IP-based rate limiting - Browser fingerprinting - Dynamic HTML structure changes - Hidden honeypot elements While Scrapy offers some built-in tools like proxy support and request delays, both BS4 and Scrapy users often need to implement additional solutions to bypass these protections. ### Maintenance Burden Perhaps the biggest challenge is keeping scrapers running over time. Websites frequently change their structure, breaking scrapers that rely on specific HTML patterns. Here’s a real-world example: Before website update: ```python # Working scraper soup.find('div', class_='product-price').text # Returns: \"$99.99\" ``` After website update, same code now returns None because the structure changed: ```python soup.find('span', class_='price-current').text # Returns: None ``` This constant need for updates creates a significant maintenance overhead, especially when managing multiple scrapers. While Scrapy’s more robust architecture helps handle some issues automatically, both tools require regular monitoring and fixes to maintain reliability. ### Resource Management Each tool presents unique resource challenges: - BS4: High memory usage when parsing large pages - Scrapy: Complex configuration for optimal performance - Both: Network bandwidth limitations - Both: Server response time variations These limitations often require careful planning and optimization, particularly for large-scale scraping projects where efficiency is crucial. ## 6\\. Modern Solutions: Introducing Firecrawl After exploring the limitations of traditional scraping tools, let’s look at how modern AI-powered solutions like Firecrawl are changing the web scraping landscape. Firecrawl takes a fundamentally different approach by using natural language understanding to identify and extract content, rather than relying on brittle HTML selectors. ### AI-Powered Content Extraction Unlike BS4 and Scrapy which require you to specify exact HTML elements, Firecrawl lets you describe what you want to extract in plain English. This semantic approach means your scrapers keep working even when websites change their structure. Here’s a practical example of scraping GitHub’s trending repositories: ```python # Import required libraries from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from dotenv import load_dotenv from typing import List # Load environment variables from .env file load_dotenv() # Define Pydantic model for a single GitHub repository class Repository(BaseModel): # Each field represents a piece of data we want to extract name: str = Field(description=\"The repository name including organization/username\") description: str = Field(description=\"The repository description\") stars: int = Field(description=\"Total number of stars\") language: str = Field(description=\"Primary programming language\") url: str = Field(description=\"The repository URL\") # Define model for the full response containing list of repositories class Repositories(BaseModel): repositories: List[Repository] = Field(description=\"List of trending repositories\") # Initialize Firecrawl app app = FirecrawlApp() # Scrape GitHub trending page using our defined schema trending_repos = app.scrape_url( 'https://github.com/trending', params={ # Specify we want to extract structured data \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": { # Use our Pydantic model schema for extraction \"schema\": Repositories.model_json_schema(), } } ) # Loop through the first 3 repositories and print their details for idx, repo in enumerate(trending_repos['extract']['repositories']): print(f\"{idx + 1}. {repo['name']}\") print(f\"⭐ {repo['stars']} stars\") print(f\"💻 {repo['language']}\") print(f\"📝 {repo['description']}\") print(f\"🔗 {repo['url']}\\n\") # Break after showing 3 repositories if idx == 2: break ``` ```python 1. pathwaycom/pathway ⭐ 11378 stars 💻 Python 📝 Python ETL framework for stream processing, real-time analytics, LLM pipelines, and RAG. 🔗 https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway 2.

Initial implementations would be straightforward and had the potential to drive significant value and productivity. Building a basic version only took an afternoon, and almost every company had a few engineers creating prototypes. Most of which fell short following contact with real users. After building AI search for companies like MongoDB, Coinbase, and Snap, we learned the nuances that make the difference between a demo and a production-ready system that actually drives value. It all comes back to a simple truth: the system is only as good as the data going in. ### Problems that come up with building Generative AI Apps As mentioned before, it is pretty easy for someone to get a basic retrieval augmented generation (RAG) search system working with a subset of company data. But as you scale with more data and users, this approach breaks and yields mediocre results at best. Here’s why: - Context crowding: Correct context for a given query gets crowded out by bad context. Take the Snap AR docs for example, they have 4 different products on their developer documentation website and they all have getting started pages. If a user asks a vague query like “how do I get started” to a basic RAG chatbot, the answer is going to most likely be an incorrect amalgamation of the 4 getting started guides. - Outdated data: Information and processes constantly iterate, and documentation is not always maintained. One of our first customers, Spectrocloud, was benchmarking our chatbot before going into production and they found that one answer in particular was not correct. At first we thought that the model (GPT-3 at the time) was hallucinating, but after manually searching the docs we found the outdated source information on an obscure part of the documentation. - Data cleanliness: If data isn’t clean, performance worsens and costs soar. We powered the chatbot on the documentation for Langchain, and data cleanliness and specifically prompt injection was a huge issue. Many of the Langchain pages had prompt examples embedded in them, which confused the model at inference time. Early on with Langchain we also noticed that a lot of unnecessary extra information was in our index like navigation menus on every page. - Data access: Accessing a variety of data sources is often critical for companies, but it introduces a host of challenges. For example, at Firecrawl, we’ve seen that many large companies simply want to access web data from their own websites, but even this can involve complex permissioning, authentication, and data-fetching hurdles. ### Forming a data strategy to solve these problems To mitigate these issues, companies building these apps should have a data strategy with the goal of curating and maintaining quality data. Based on the aforementioned problems, here are some practical suggestions to guide your strategy. - Metadata Management: Good metadata is your first defense against context crowding. Every piece of content should be tagged with essential details like product association, who created it, and who can access it. This enables advanced filtering and more accurate responses. - Data Maintenance: To keep data fresh and reliable, the teams that create content should be responsible for regular reviews and updates. When underlying information changes, the corresponding documentation needs to change with it. - Data Sanitation: Raw data rarely arrives in ideal form. Before ingestion, strip away unnecessary formatting and information while preserving the essential details. While each content source requires different handling, tools like Unstructured can help standardize this process. - Data Access & Integration: Build the infrastructure to access your data sources seamlessly. You’ll need continuous data flow from knowledge bases, ticketing systems, websites, and more. Tools like Firecrawl can help build these pipelines and ensure high-quality data ingestion. ### Conclusion The industry is still in the early stages of solving these complex issues, there’s also significant opportunity for innovative companies to emerge and tackle various aspects of this problem. Startups like Glean, Unstructured, and our own Firecrawl have made some incredible progress, but no one has solved it all. No matter what tools emerge to make the process easier, having a robust data strategy is foundational to building production ready Generative AI Apps.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through setting up Grok-2, obtaining an API key, and then building a web crawler using Firecrawl to extract structured data from any website. ## Part 1: Setting Up Grok-2 Before diving into coding, we need to set up Grok-2 and get an API key. ### Step 1: Sign Up for an x.ai Account To access the Grok-2 API, you’ll need an x.ai account. 1. **Visit the Sign-Up Page:** Go to [x.ai Sign-Up](https://accounts.x.ai/sign-up?redirect=cloud-console). 2. **Register:** Fill out the registration form with your email and create a password. 3. **Verify Your Email:** Check your inbox for a verification email from x.ai and click the link to verify your account. ### Step 2: Fund Your Account To use the Grok-2 API, your account must have funds. 1. **Access the Cloud Console:** After logging in, you’ll be directed to the x.ai Cloud Console. 2. **Navigate to Billing:** Click on the **Billing** tab in the sidebar. 3. **Add Payment Method:** Provide your payment details to add credits to your account. ### Step 3: Obtain Your API Key With your account funded, you can now generate an API key. 1. **Go to API Keys:** Click on the **API Keys** tab in the Cloud Console. 2. **Create a New API Key:** Click on **Create New API Key** and give it a descriptive name. 3. **Copy Your API Key:** Make sure to copy your API key now, as it won’t be displayed again for security reasons. _Note: Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly._ ## Part 2: Building a Web Crawler with Grok-2 and Firecrawl Now that Grok-2 is set up, let’s build a web crawler to extract structured data from websites. ### Prerequisites - **Python 3.6+** - **Firecrawl Python Library** - **Requests Library** - **dotenv Library** Install the required packages: ```bash pip install firecrawl-py requests python-dotenv ``` ### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables Create a `.env` file in your project directory to store your API keys securely. ```env GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key ``` _Replace `your_grok_api_key` and `your_firecrawl_api_key` with your actual API keys._ ### Step 2: Initialize Your Script Create a new Python script (e.g., `web_crawler.py`) and start by importing the necessary libraries and loading your environment variables. ```python import os import json import requests from dotenv import load_dotenv from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp # Load environment variables from .env file load_dotenv() # Retrieve API keys grok_api_key = os.getenv(\"GROK_API_KEY\") firecrawl_api_key = os.getenv(\"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\") # Initialize FirecrawlApp app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=firecrawl_api_key) ``` ### Step 3: Define the Grok-2 API Interaction Function We need a function to interact with the Grok-2 API. ```python def grok_completion(prompt): url = \"https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions\" headers = { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {grok_api_key}\" } data = { \"messages\": [\\ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\\ ], \"model\": \"grok-2\", \"stream\": False, \"temperature\": 0 } response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data) response_data = response.json() return response_data['choices'][0]['message']['content'] ``` ### Step 4: Identify Relevant Pages on the Website Define a function to find pages related to our objective. ```python def find_relevant_pages(objective, url): prompt = f\"Based on the objective '{objective}', suggest a 1-2 word search term to locate relevant information on the website.\" search_term = grok_completion(prompt).strip() map_result = app.map_url(url, params={\"search\": search_term}) return map_result.get(\"links\", []) ``` ### Step 5: Extract Data from the Pages Create a function to scrape the pages and extract the required data. ```python def extract_data_from_pages(links, objective): for link in links[:3]: # Limit to top 3 links scrape_result = app.scrape_url(link, params={'formats': ['markdown']}) content = scrape_result.get('markdown', '') prompt = f\"\"\"Given the following content, extract the information related to the objective '{objective}' in JSON format. If not found, reply 'Objective not met'. Content: {content} Remember: - Only return JSON if the objective is met. - Do not include any extra text. \"\"\" result = grok_completion(prompt).strip() if result != \"Objective not met\": try: data = json.loads(result) return data except json.JSONDecodeError: continue # Try the next link if JSON parsing fails return None ``` ### Step 6: Implement the Main Function Combine everything into a main function. ```python def main(): url = input(\"Enter the website URL to crawl: \") objective = input(\"Enter your data extraction objective: \") print(\"\\nFinding relevant pages...\") links = find_relevant_pages(objective, url) if not links: print(\"No relevant pages found.\") return print(\"Extracting data from pages...\") data = extract_data_from_pages(links, objective) if data: print(\"\\nData extracted successfully:\") print(json.dumps(data, indent=2)) else: print(\"Could not find data matching the objective.\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() ``` ### Step 7: Run the Script Save your script and run it from the command line. ```bash python web_crawler.py ``` **Example Interaction:** ``` Enter the website URL to crawl: https://example.com Enter your data extraction objective: Retrieve the list of services offered. Finding relevant pages... Extracting data from pages... Data extracted successfully: { \"services\": [\\ \"Web Development\",\\ \"SEO Optimization\",\\ \"Digital Marketing\"\\ ] } ``` ## Conclusion In this tutorial, we’ve successfully set up Grok-2, obtained an API key, and built a web crawler using Firecrawl. This powerful combination allows you to automate the process of extracting structured data from websites, making it a valuable tool for various applications. ## Next Steps - **Explore More Features:** Check out the Grok-2 and Firecrawl documentation to learn about additional functionalities. - **Enhance Error Handling:** Improve the script with better error handling and logging. - **Customize Data Extraction:** Modify the extraction logic to suit different objectives or data types. ## References - [x.ai Grok-2 API Documentation](https://docs.x.ai/docs) - [Firecrawl Python Library Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python) - [x.ai Cloud Console](https://accounts.x.ai/cloud-console) - [GitHub Repository with Full Code](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/tree/main/examples/grok_web_crawler) Article updated recently [🔥](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) ## Ready to _Build?_ Start scraping web data for your AI apps today.

You can get your Groq API key from [here](https://groq.com/) and your Firecrawl API key from [here](https://firecrawl.dev/). ## Load website with Firecrawl To be able to get all the data from a website page and make sure it is in the cleanest format, we will use [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/). It handles by-passing JS-blocked websites, extracting the main content, and outputting in a LLM-readable format for increased accuracy. Here is how we will scrape a website url using Firecrawl. We will also set a `pageOptions` for only extracting the main content ( `onlyMainContent: True`) of the website page - excluding the navs, footers, etc. ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp # Importing the FireCrawlLoader url = \"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/introducing-our-open-mixed-reality-ecosystem/\" firecrawl = FirecrawlApp( api_key=\"fc-YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\", ) page_content = firecrawl.scrape_url(url=url, # Target URL to crawl params={ \"pageOptions\":{ \"onlyMainContent\": True # Ignore navs, footers, etc. } }) print(page_content) ``` Perfect, now we have clean data from the website - ready to be fed to the LLM for data extraction. ## Extraction and Generation Now that we have the website data, let’s use Groq to pull out the information we need. We’ll use Groq Llama 3 model in JSON mode and pick out certain fields from the page content. We are using LLama 3 8b model for this example. Feel free to use bigger models for improved results. ```python import json from groq import Groq client = Groq( api_key=\"gsk_YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY\", # Note: Replace 'API_KEY' with your actual Groq API key ) # Here we define the fields we want to extract from the page content extract = [\"summary\",\"date\",\"companies_building_with_quest\",\"title_of_the_article\",\"people_testimonials\"] completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"llama3-8b-8192\", messages=[\\ {\\ \"role\": \"system\",\\ \"content\": \"You are a legal advisor who extracts information from documents in JSON.\"\\ },\\ {\\ \"role\": \"user\",\\ # Here we pass the page content and the fields we want to extract\\ \"content\": f\"Extract the following information from the provided documentation:\\Page content:\\n\\n{page_content}\\n\\nInformation to extract: {extract}\"\\ }\\ ], temperature=0, max_tokens=1024, top_p=1, stream=False, stop=None, # We set the response format to JSON object response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"} ) # Pretty print the JSON response dataExtracted = json.dumps(str(completion.choices[0].message.content), indent=4) print(dataExtracted) ``` One pro tip is to use an LLM montioring system like [Traceloop](https://www.traceloop.com/) with these calls. This will allow you to quickly test and monitor output quality. ## And Voila! You have now built a data extraction bot using Groq and Firecrawl. You can now use this bot to extract structured data from any website. If you are looking to deploy your own models instead of using the choices Groq gives you, you can try out [Cerebrium](https://www.cerebrium.ai/) which hosts custom models blazingly fast.

However, most examples only scratch the surface with basic prompts rather than showing practical real-world implementations. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to harness this powerful open-source model to create a documentation assistant powered by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Our application will be able to intelligently answer questions about any documentation website by combining DeepSeek’s language capabilities with efficient information retrieval. For those eager to try it out, you can find installation and usage instructions [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/BexTuychiev/local-documentation-rag). If you’re interested in understanding how the application works and learning to customize it for your needs, continue reading this detailed walkthrough. ## What Is DeepSeek R1? [DeepSeek R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) represents a notable advancement in artificial intelligence, combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning in a novel and most importantly, open-source approach. The model comes in two variants: DeepSeek-R1-Zero, trained purely through reinforcement learning, and DeepSeek-R1, which undergoes additional training steps. Its architecture manages 671 billion total parameters, though it operates efficiently with 37 billion active parameters and handles context lengths up to 128,000 tokens. The development journey progressed through carefully planned stages. Beginning with supervised fine-tuning for core capabilities, the model then underwent two phases of reinforcement learning. These RL stages shaped its reasoning patterns and aligned its behavior with human thought processes. This methodical approach produced a system capable of generating responses, performing self-verification, engaging in reflection, and constructing detailed reasoning across mathematics, programming, and general problem-solving. When it comes to performance, DeepSeek R1 demonstrates compelling results that rival OpenAI’s offerings. It achieves 97.3% accuracy on MATH-500, reaches the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming challenges, and scores 90.8% on the MMLU general knowledge assessment. The technology has also been distilled into smaller versions ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, built on established frameworks like Qwen and Llama. These adaptations make the technology more accessible for practical use while preserving its core strengths. In this tutorial, we will use its 14B version but your hardware may support up to 70B parameters. It is important to choose a higher capacity model as this number is the biggest contributor to performance. ## Prerequisite: Revisiting RAG concepts [Source](https://www.patrickschnass.de/posts/rag_intro/) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with information. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on their training data, RAG combines the power of language models with the ability to retrieve and reference external information in real-time. This approach effectively creates a bridge between the model’s inherent knowledge and up-to-date, specific information stored in external databases or documents. The RAG architecture consists of two main components: the retriever and the generator. The retriever is responsible for searching through a knowledge base to find relevant information based on the user’s query. This process typically involves converting both the query and stored documents into vector embeddings, allowing for semantic similarity searches that go beyond simple keyword matching. The generator, usually an LLM, then takes both the original query and the retrieved information to produce a comprehensive, contextually relevant response. One of RAG’s key advantages is its ability to provide more accurate and verifiable responses. By grounding the model’s outputs in specific, retrievable sources, RAG helps reduce hallucinations – instances where LLMs generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information. This is particularly valuable in professional contexts where accuracy and accountability are crucial, such as technical documentation, customer support, or legal applications. Additionally, RAG systems can be updated with new information without requiring retraining of the underlying language model, making them more flexible and maintainable. The implementation of RAG typically involves several technical components working in harmony. First, documents are processed and converted into embeddings using models like BERT or Sentence Transformers. These embeddings are then stored in vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS for efficient retrieval. When a query arrives, it goes through the same embedding process, and similarity search algorithms find the most relevant documents. Finally, these documents, along with the original query, are formatted into a prompt that the LLM uses to generate its response. This structured approach ensures that the final output is both relevant and grounded in reliable source material. Now that we’ve refreshed our memory on basic RAG concepts, let’s dive in to the app’s implementation. ## Overview of the App Before diving into the technical details, let’s walk through a typical user journey to understand how the documentation assistant works. The process starts with the user providing documentation URLs to scrape. The app is designed to work with any documentation website, but here are some examples of typical documentation pages: - `https://docs.firecrawl.dev` - `https://docs.langchain.com` - `https://docs.streamlit.io` The app’s interface is divided into two main sections: a sidebar for documentation management and a main chat interface. In the sidebar, users can: 1. Enter a documentation URL to scrape 2. Specify a name for the documentation (must end with “-docs”) 3. Optionally limit the number of pages to scrape 4. View and select from previously scraped documentation sets When a user initiates scraping, the app uses Firecrawl to intelligently crawl the documentation website, converting HTML content into clean markdown files. These files are stored locally in a directory named after the documentation (e.g., “Firecrawl-docs”). The app shows real-time progress during scraping and notifies the user when complete. After scraping, the documentation is processed into a vector database using the Nomic embeddings model. This enables semantic search capabilities, allowing the assistant to find relevant documentation sections based on user questions. The processing happens automatically when a user selects a documentation set from the sidebar. The main chat interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the documentation: 1. Users can ask questions in natural language about the selected documentation 2. The app uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to find relevant documentation sections 3. DeepSeek R1 generates accurate, contextual responses based on the retrieved content 4. Each response includes an expandable “View reasoning” section showing the chain of thought Users can switch between different documentation sets at any time, and the app will automatically reprocess the vectors as needed. This approach combines the power of modern AI with traditional documentation search, creating a more interactive and intelligent way to explore technical documentation. Whether you’re learning a new framework or trying to solve a specific problem, the assistant helps you find and understand relevant documentation more efficiently than traditional search methods. ## The Tech Stack Used in the App Building an effective documentation assistant requires tools that can handle complex tasks like web scraping, text processing, and natural language understanding while remaining maintainable and efficient. Let’s explore the core technologies that power our application and why each was chosen: ### 1\\. [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) for AI-powered documentation scraping At the heart of our documentation collection system is Firecrawl, an AI-powered web scraping engine. Unlike traditional scraping libraries that rely on brittle HTML selectors, Firecrawl uses natural language understanding to identify and extract content. This makes it ideal for our use case because: - It can handle diverse documentation layouts without custom code - Maintains reliability even when documentation structure changes - Automatically extracts clean markdown content - Handles JavaScript-rendered documentation sites - Provides metadata like titles and URLs automatically - Follows documentation links intelligently ### 2\\. [DeepSeek R1](https://deepseek.ai/) for question answering For the critical task of answering documentation questions, we use the DeepSeek R1 14B model through Ollama. This AI model excels at understanding technical documentation and providing accurate responses. We chose DeepSeek R1 because: - Runs locally for better privacy and lower latency - Specifically trained on technical content - Provides detailed explanations with chain-of-thought reasoning - More cost-effective than cloud-based models - Integrates well with LangChain for RAG workflows ### 3\\. [Nomic Embeddings](https://docs.nomic.ai/) for semantic search To enable semantic search across documentation, we use Nomic’s text embedding model through [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). This component is crucial for finding relevant documentation sections. We chose Nomic because: - Optimized for technical documentation - Runs locally alongside DeepSeek through Ollama - Produces high-quality embeddings for RAG - Fast inference speed - Compact model size ### 4\\. [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) for vector storage To store and query document embeddings efficiently, we use ChromaDB as our vector database. This modern vector store offers: - Lightweight and easy to set up - Persistent storage of embeddings - Fast similarity search - Seamless integration with LangChain - No external dependencies ### 5\\. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for user interface The web interface is built with Streamlit, a Python framework for data applications. We chose Streamlit because: - It enables rapid development of chat interfaces - Provides built-in components for file handling - Handles async operations smoothly - Maintains chat history during sessions - Requires minimal frontend code - Makes deployment straightforward ### 6\\. [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for RAG orchestration To coordinate the various components into a cohesive RAG system, we use LangChain. This framework provides: - Standard interfaces for embeddings and LLMs - Document loading and text splitting utilities - Vector store integration - Prompt management - Structured output parsing This carefully selected stack provides a robust foundation while keeping the system entirely local and self-contained. The combination of AI-powered tools (Firecrawl and DeepSeek) with modern infrastructure (ChromaDB, LangChain, and Ollama) creates a reliable and efficient documentation assistant that can handle diverse technical documentation. Most importantly, this stack minimizes both latency and privacy concerns by running all AI components locally. The infrastructure is lightweight and portable, letting you focus on using the documentation rather than managing complex dependencies or cloud services. ## Breaking Down the App Components When you look at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/BexTuychiev/local-documentation-rag/tree/main/src) of the app, you will see the following file structure: Several files in the repository serve common purposes that most developers will recognize: - `.gitignore`: Specifies which files Git should ignore when tracking changes - `README.md`: Documentation explaining what the project does and how to use it - `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python package dependencies needed to run the project Let’s examine the remaining Python scripts and understand how they work together to power the application. The explanations will be in a logical order building from foundational elements to higher-level functionality. ### 1\\. Scraping Documentation with Firecrawl - `src/scraper.py` The documentation scraper component handles fetching and processing documentation pages using Firecrawl’s AI capabilities. Let’s examine how each part works: First, we make the necessary imports and setup: ```python import logging import os import re from pathlib import Path from typing import List from dotenv import load_dotenv from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field # Get logger for the scraper module logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) ``` Then, we define the core data structure for documentation pages: ```python class DocPage(BaseModel): title: str = Field(description=\"Page title\") content: str = Field(description=\"Main content of the page\") url: str = Field(description=\"Page URL\") ``` The `DocPage` model represents a single documentation page with three essential fields: - `title`: The page’s heading or title - `content`: The main markdown content of the page - `url`: Direct link to the original page This model is used by both the scraper to structure extracted content and the RAG system to process documentation for the vector store. The main scraper class handles all documentation collection: ```python class DocumentationScraper: def init(self): self.app = FirecrawlApp() ``` The `DocumentationScraper` initializes a connection to Firecrawl and provides three main methods for documentation collection: 1. `get_documentation_links`: Discovers all documentation pages from a base URL: ```python def get_documentation_links(self, base_url: str) -> list[str]: \"\"\"Get all documentation page links from a given base URL.\"\"\" logger.info(f\"Getting documentation links from {base_url}\") initial_crawl = self.app.crawl_url( base_url, params={ \"scrapeOptions\": {\"formats\": [\"links\"]}, }, ) all_links = [] for item in initial_crawl[\"data\"]: all_links.extend(item[\"links\"]) filtered_links = set( [link.split(\"#\")[0] for link in all_links if link.startswith(base_url)] ) logger.info(f\"Found {len(filtered_links)} unique documentation links\") return list(filtered_links) ``` This method: - Uses Firecrawl’s link extraction mode to find all URLs - Filters for links within the same documentation domain - Removes duplicate URLs and anchor fragments - Returns a clean list of documentation page URLs 2. `scrape_documentation`: Processes all documentation pages into structured content: ```python def scrape_documentation(self, base_url: str, limit: int = None): \"\"\"Scrape documentation pages from a given base URL.\"\"\" logger.info(f\"Scraping doc pages from {base_url}\") filtered_links = self.get_documentation_links(base_url) if limit: filtered_links = filtered_links[:limit] try: logger.info(f\"Scraping {len(filtered_links)} documentation pages\") crawl_results = self.app.batch_scrape_urls(filtered_links) except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Error scraping documentation pages: {str(e)}\") return [] doc_pages = [] for result in crawl_results[\"data\"]: if result.get(\"markdown\"): doc_pages.append( DocPage( title=result.get(\"metadata\", {}).get(\"title\", \"Untitled\"), content=result[\"markdown\"], url=result.get(\"metadata\", {}).get(\"url\", \"\"), ) ) else: logger.warning( f\"Failed to scrape {result.get('metadata', {}).get('url', 'unknown URL')}\" ) logger.info(f\"Successfully scraped {len(doc_pages)} pages out of {len(filtered_links)} URLs\") return doc_pages ``` This method: - Gets all documentation links using the previous method - Optionally limits the number of pages to scrape - Uses Firecrawl’s batch scraping to efficiently process multiple pages - Converts raw scraping results into structured `DocPage` objects - Handles errors and provides detailed logging 3. `save_documentation_pages`: Stores scraped content as markdown files: ```python def save_documentation_pages(self, doc_pages: List[DocPage], docs_dir: str): \"\"\"Save scraped documentation pages to markdown files.\"\"\" Path(docs_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) for page in doc_pages: url_path = page.url.replace(\"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\", \"\") safe_filename = url_path.strip(\"/\").replace(\"/\", \"-\") filepath = os.path.join(docs_dir, f\"{safe_filename}.md\") with open(filepath, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f: f.write(\"---\\n\") f.write(f\"title: {page.title}\\n\") f.write(f\"url: {page.url}\\n\") f.write(\"---\\n\\n\") f.write(page.content) logger.info(f\"Saved {len(doc_pages)} pages to {docs_dir}\") ``` This method: - Creates a documentation directory if needed - Converts URLs to safe filenames - Saves each page as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter - Preserves original titles and URLs for reference Finally, the class provides a convenience method to handle the entire scraping workflow: ```python def pull_docs(self, base_url: str, docs_dir: str, n_pages: int = None): doc_pages = self.scrape_documentation(base_url, n_pages) self.save_documentation_pages(doc_pages, docs_dir) ``` This scraper component is used by: - The Streamlit interface ( `app.py`) for initial documentation collection - The RAG system ( `rag.py`) for processing documentation into the vector store - The command-line interface for testing and manual scraping The use of Firecrawl’s AI capabilities allows the scraper to handle diverse documentation layouts without custom selectors, while the structured output ensures consistency for downstream processing. ### 2\\. Implementing RAG with Ollama - `src/rag.py` The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) component is the core of our documentation assistant, handling document processing, embedding generation, and question answering. Let’s examine each part in detail: First, we import the necessary LangChain components: ```python from langchain_chroma import Chroma from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama, OllamaEmbeddings from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter ``` These imports provide: - `Chroma`: Vector database for storing embeddings - `DirectoryLoader`: Utility for loading markdown files from a directory - `ChatPromptTemplate`: Template system for LLM prompts - `ChatOllama` and `OllamaEmbeddings`: Local LLM and embedding models - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`: Text chunking utility The main RAG class initializes all necessary components: ```python class DocumentationRAG: def __init__(self): # Initialize embeddings and vector store self.embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=\"nomic-embed-text\") self.vector_store = Chroma( embedding_function=self.embeddings, persist_directory=\"./chroma_db\" ) # Initialize LLM self.llm = ChatOllama(model=\"deepseek-r1:14b\") # Text splitter for chunking self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) ``` The initialization: 1. Creates an embedding model using Nomic’s text embeddings 2. Sets up a Chroma vector store with persistent storage 3. Initializes the DeepSeek R1 14B model for question answering 4. Configures a text splitter with 1000-character chunks and 200-character overlap The prompt template defines how the LLM should process questions: ```python # RAG prompt template self.prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( \"\"\" You are an expert documentation assistant. Use the following documentation context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't have enough information. Keep the answer concise and clear. Context: {context} Question: {question} Answer:\"\"\" ) ``` This template: - Sets the assistant’s role and behavior - Provides placeholders for context and questions - Encourages concise and clear responses The document loading method handles reading markdown files: ```python def load_docs_from_directory(self, docs_dir: str): \"\"\"Load all markdown documents from a directory\"\"\" markdown_docs = DirectoryLoader(docs_dir, glob=\"*.md\").load() return markdown_docs ``` This method: - Uses `DirectoryLoader` to find all markdown files - Automatically handles file reading and basic preprocessing - Returns a list of Document objects The document processing method prepares content for the vector store: ```python def process_documents(self, docs_dir: str): \"\"\"Process documents and add to vector store\"\"\" # Clear existing documents self.vector_store = Chroma( embedding_function=self.embeddings, persist_directory=\"./chroma_db\" ) # Load and process new documents documents = self.load_docs_from_directory(docs_dir) chunks = self.text_splitter.split_documents(documents) self.vector_store.add_documents(chunks) ``` This method: 1. Reinitializes the vector store to clear existing documents 2. Loads new documents from the specified directory 3. Splits documents into manageable chunks 4. Generates and stores embeddings in the vector database Finally, the query method handles question answering: ```python def query(self, question: str) -> tuple[str, str]: \"\"\"Query the documentation\"\"\" # Get relevant documents docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(question, k=3) # Combine context context = \"\\n\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs]) # Generate response chain = self.prompt | self.llm response = chain.invoke({\"context\": context, \"question\": question}) # Extract chain of thought between and chain_of_thought = response.content.split(\"\")[1].split(\"\")[0] # Extract response response = response.content.split(\"\")[1].strip() return response, chain_of_thought ``` The query process: 1. Performs semantic search to find the 3 most relevant document chunks 2. Combines the chunks into a single context string 3. Creates a LangChain chain combining the prompt and LLM 4. Generates a response with chain-of-thought reasoning 5. Extracts and returns both the final answer and reasoning process This RAG component is used by: - The Streamlit interface ( `app.py`) for handling user questions - The command-line interface for testing and development - Future extensions that need documentation Q&A capabilities The implementation uses LangChain’s abstractions to create a modular and maintainable system while keeping all AI components running locally through Ollama. ### 3\\. Building a clean UI with Streamlit - `src/app.py` The Streamlit interface brings together the scraping and RAG components into a user-friendly web application. Let’s break down each component: First, we set up basic configuration and utilities: ```python import glob import logging from pathlib import Path import streamlit as st from dotenv import load_dotenv from rag import DocumentationRAG from scraper import DocumentationScraper # Configure logging logging.basicConfig( level=logging.INFO, format=\"%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\", handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()], ) logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) ``` These imports and configurations: - Set up logging for debugging and monitoring - Import our custom RAG and scraper components - Load environment variables for configuration Helper functions handle documentation management: ```python def get_existing_docs(): \"\"\"Get all documentation directories with -docs suffix\"\"\" docs_dirs = glob.glob(\"*-docs\") return [Path(dir_path).name for dir_path in docs_dirs] def get_doc_page_count(docs_dir: str) -> int: \"\"\"Get number of markdown files in a documentation directory\"\"\" return len(list(Path(docs_dir).glob(\"*.md\"))) ``` These utilities: - Find all documentation directories with “-docs” suffix - Count pages in each documentation set - Support the UI’s documentation selection features The scraping configuration section handles documentation collection: ```python def scraping_config_section(): \"\"\"Create the documentation scraping configuration section\"\"\" st.markdown(\"### Configure Scraping\") base_url = st.text_input( \"Documentation URL\", placeholder=\"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\", help=\"The base URL of the documentation to scrape\", ) docs_name = st.text_input( \"Documentation Name\", placeholder=\"Firecrawl-docs\", help=\"Name of the directory to store documentation\", ) n_pages = st.number_input( \"Number of Pages\", min_value=0, value=0, help=\"Limit the number of pages to scrape (0 for all pages)\", ) st.info( \"💡 Add '-docs' suffix to the documentation name. \" \"Set pages to 0 to scrape all available pages.\" ) if st.button(\"Start Scraping\"): if not base_url or not docs_name: st.error(\"Please provide both URL and documentation name\") elif not docs_name.endswith(\"-docs\"): st.error(\"Documentation name must end with '-docs'\") else: with st.spinner(\"Scraping documentation...\"): try: scraper = DocumentationScraper() n_pages = None if n_pages == 0 else n_pages scraper.pull_docs(base_url, docs_name, n_pages=n_pages) st.success(\"Documentation scraped successfully!\") except Exception as e: st.error(f\"Error scraping documentation: {str(e)}\") ``` This section: - Provides input fields for documentation URL and name - Allows limiting the number of pages to scrape - Handles validation and error reporting - Shows progress during scraping - Uses our `DocumentationScraper` class for content collection The documentation selection interface manages switching between docs: ```python def documentation_select_section(): \"\"\"Create the documentation selection section\"\"\" st.markdown(\"### Select Documentation\") existing_docs = get_existing_docs() if not existing_docs: st.caption(\"No documentation found yet\") return None # Create options with page counts doc_options = [f\"{doc} ({get_doc_page_count(doc)} pages)\" for doc in existing_docs] selected_doc = st.selectbox( \"Choose documentation to use as context\", options=doc_options, help=\"Select which documentation to use for answering questions\", ) if selected_doc: # Extract the actual doc name without page count st.session_state.current_doc = selected_doc.split(\" (\")[0] return st.session_state.current_doc return None ``` This component: - Lists available documentation sets - Shows page counts for each set - Updates session state when selection changes - Handles the case of no available documentation The chat interface consists of two main functions that work together to create the interactive Q&A experience: First, we initialize the necessary session state: ```python def initialize_chat_state(): \"\"\"Initialize session state for chat\"\"\" if \"messages\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.messages = [] if \"rag\" not in st.session_state: st.session_state.rag = DocumentationRAG() ``` This initialization: - Creates an empty message list if none exists - Sets up the RAG system for document processing and querying - Uses Streamlit’s session state to persist data between reruns The main chat interface starts with basic setup: ```python def chat_interface(): \"\"\"Create the chat interface\"\"\" st.title(\"Documentation Assistant\") # Check if documentation is selected if \"current_doc\" not in st.session_state: st.info(\"Please select a documentation from the sidebar to start chatting.\") return ``` This section: - Sets the page title - Ensures documentation is selected before proceeding - Shows a helpful message if no documentation is chosen Document processing is handled next: ```python # Process documentation if not already processed if ( \"docs_processed\" not in st.session_state or st.session_state.docs_processed != st.session_state.current_doc ): with st.spinner(\"Processing documentation...\"): st.session_state.rag.process_documents(st.session_state.current_doc) st.session_state.docs_processed = st.session_state.current_doc ``` This block: - Checks if the current documentation needs processing - Shows a loading spinner during processing - Updates the session state after processing - Prevents unnecessary reprocessing of the same documentation Message display is handled by iterating through the chat history: ```python # Display chat messages for message in st.session_state.messages: with st.chat_message(message[\"role\"]): st.markdown(message[\"content\"]) if \"chain_of_thought\" in message: with st.expander(\"View reasoning\"): st.markdown(message[\"chain_of_thought\"]) ``` This section: - Shows each message with appropriate styling based on role - Displays the main content using markdown - Creates expandable sections for reasoning chains - Maintains visual consistency in the chat Finally, the input handling and response generation: ```python # Chat input if prompt := st.chat_input(\"Ask a question about the documentation\"): # Add user message st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}) with st.chat_message(\"user\"): st.markdown(prompt) # Generate and display response with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"): with st.spinner(\"Thinking...\"): response, chain_of_thought = st.session_state.rag.query(prompt) st.markdown(response) with st.expander(\"View reasoning\"): st.markdown(chain_of_thought) # Store assistant response st.session_state.messages.append({ \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response, \"chain_of_thought\": chain_of_thought, }) ``` This section: 1. Captures user input: - Uses Streamlit’s chat input component - Stores the message in session state - Displays the message immediately 2. Generates response: - Shows a “thinking” spinner during processing - Queries the RAG system for an answer - Displays the response with expandable reasoning 3. Updates chat history: - Stores both response and reasoning - Maintains the conversation flow - Preserves the interaction for future reference The entire chat interface creates a seamless experience by: - Managing state effectively - Providing immediate feedback - Showing processing status - Maintaining conversation context - Exposing the AI’s reasoning process Finally, the main application structure: ```python def sidebar(): \"\"\"Create the sidebar UI components\"\"\" with st.sidebar: st.title(\"Documentation Scraper\") scraping_config_section() documentation_select_section() def main(): initialize_chat_state() sidebar() chat_interface() if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() ``` This structure: - Organizes UI components into sidebar and main area - Initializes necessary state on startup - Provides a clean entry point for the application The Streamlit interface brings together all components into a cohesive application that: - Makes documentation scraping accessible to non-technical users - Provides immediate feedback during operations - Maintains conversation history - Shows the AI’s reasoning process - Handles errors gracefully ## How to Increase System Performance There are several ways to optimize the performance of this documentation assistant. The following sections explore key areas for potential improvements: ### 1\\. Optimize document chunking In `rag.py`, we currently use a basic chunking strategy: ```python self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) ``` We can improve this by: - Using semantic chunking that respects document structure - Adjusting chunk size based on content type (e.g., larger for API docs) - Implementing custom splitting rules for documentation headers - Adding metadata to chunks for better context preservation Example improved configuration: ```python self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1500, # Larger chunks for more context chunk_overlap=300, # Increased overlap for better coherence separators=[\"\\n## \", \"\\n### \", \"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"], # Respect markdown structure add_start_index=True, length_function=len, is_separator_regex=False ) ``` ### 2\\. Enhance vector search The current similarity search in `rag.py` is basic: ```python docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(question, k=3) ``` We can improve retrieval by: - Increasing `k`, i.e. the number of chunks returned - Implementing hybrid search (combining semantic and keyword matching) - Using Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) for diverse results - Adding metadata filtering based on document sections - Implementing re-ranking of retrieved chunks Example enhanced retrieval: ```python def query(self, question: str) -> tuple[str, str]: # Get relevant documents with MMR docs = self.vector_store.max_marginal_relevance_search( question, k=5, # Retrieve more candidates fetch_k=20, # Consider larger initial set lambda_mult=0.7 # Diversity factor ) # Filter and re-rank results filtered_docs = [\\ doc for doc in docs\\ if self._calculate_relevance_score(doc, question) > 0.7\\ ] # Use top 3 most relevant chunks context = \"\\n\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in filtered_docs[:3]]) ``` ### 3\\. Implement caching The current implementation reprocesses documentation on every selection: ```python if ( \"docs_processed\" not in st.session_state or st.session_state.docs_processed != st.session_state.current_doc ): with st.spinner(\"Processing documentation...\"): st.session_state.rag.process_documents(st.session_state.current_doc) ``` We can improve this by: - Implementing persistent vector storage with versioning - Caching processed embeddings - Adding incremental updates for documentation changes Example caching implementation: ```python from hashlib import md5 import pickle class CachedDocumentationRAG(DocumentationRAG): def process_documents(self, docs_dir: str): cache_key = self._get_cache_key(docs_dir) cache_path = f\"cache/{cache_key}.pkl\" if os.path.exists(cache_path): with open(cache_path, 'rb') as f: self.vector_store = pickle.load(f) else: super().process_documents(docs_dir) os.makedirs(\"cache\", exist_ok=True) with open(cache_path, 'wb') as f: pickle.dump(self.vector_store, f) ``` ### 4\\. Optimize model loading Currently, we initialize models in `__init__`: ```python def __init__(self): self.embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=\"nomic-embed-text\") self.llm = ChatOllama(model=\"deepseek-r1:14b\") ``` We can improve this by: - Implementing lazy loading of models - Using smaller models for initial responses - Adding model quantization options - Implementing model caching Example optimized initialization: ```python class OptimizedDocumentationRAG: def __init__(self, use_small_model=True): self._embeddings = None self._llm = None self._use_small_model = use_small_model @property def llm(self): if self._llm is None: model_size = \"7b\" if self._use_small_model else \"14b\" self._llm = ChatOllama( model=f\"deepseek-r1:{model_size}\", temperature=0.1, # Lower temperature for docs num_ctx=2048 # Reduced context for faster inference ) return self._llm ``` These optimizations can significantly improve: - Response latency - Memory usage - Processing throughput - User experience Remember to benchmark performance before and after implementing these changes to measure their impact. Also, consider your specific use case - some optimizations might be more relevant depending on factors like user load, documentation size, and hardware constraints. ## Conclusion This local documentation assistant demonstrates how modern AI technologies can be combined to create powerful, practical tools for technical documentation. By using DeepSeek’s language capabilities, Firecrawl’s AI-powered scraping, and the RAG architecture, we’ve built a system that makes documentation more accessible and interactive. The application’s modular design, with clear separation between scraping, RAG implementation, and user interface components, provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and adaptations to different documentation needs. Most importantly, this implementation shows that sophisticated AI applications can be built entirely with local components, eliminating privacy concerns and reducing operational costs. The combination of Streamlit’s intuitive interface, LangChain’s flexible abstractions, and Ollama’s local AI models creates a seamless experience that feels like a cloud service but runs entirely on your machine. Whether you’re a developer learning a new framework, a technical writer maintaining documentation, or a team lead looking to improve documentation accessibility, this assistant provides a practical solution that can be customized and extended to meet your specific needs.

While humans can easily read and understand web content, turning that information into structured data for AI applications often requires complex code and constant maintenance. Traditional web scraping tools break when websites change, and writing separate code for each website quickly becomes overwhelming. Firecrawl’s extract endpoint changes this by using AI to automatically understand and pull data from any website. Whether you need to gather product information from multiple stores, collect training data for AI models, or keep track of competitor prices, the extract endpoint can handle it with just a few lines of code. Similar to our previous guides about Firecrawl’s [scrape](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint), [crawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-the-crawl-endpoint-in-firecrawl), and [map](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/how-to-generate-sitemaps-using-firecrawl-map-endpoint) endpoints, this article will show you how to use this powerful new tool to gather structured data from the web reliably and efficiently. ## Understanding the Extract Endpoint The extract endpoint is different from Firecrawl’s other tools because it can understand and process entire websites at once, not just single pages. Think of it like having a smart assistant who can read through a whole website and pick out exactly the information you need, whether that’s from one page or thousands of pages. Here’s what makes the extract endpoint special: - It can process multiple URLs at once, saving you time and effort - You can use simple English to describe what data you want, no extra coding required - It works with entire websites by adding `/*` to the URL (like `website.com/*`) - If requested information is not found in the given URL, the **web search** feature can automatically search related links on the page to find and extract the missing data The extract endpoint is perfect for three main tasks: 1. **Full website data collection**: Gathering information from every page on a website, like product details from an online store 2. **Data enrichment**: Adding extra information to your existing data by finding details across multiple websites 3. **AI training data**: Creating clean, structured datasets to train AI models At the time of writing the article, you will have 500k free output tokens for the endpoint when you sign up for an account. [The pricing page](https://www.firecrawl.dev/extract#pricing) also contains information on other pricing options. ## Getting Started with Extract Let’s set up everything you need to start using the extract endpoint. First, you’ll need to sign up for a free Firecrawl account at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev/) to get your API key. Once you have your account, follow these simple steps to get started: 1. Create a new project folder and set up your environment: ```bash # Create a new folder and move into it mkdir extract-project cd extract-project # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # For Unix/macOS venv\\Scripts\\activate # For Windows # Install the required packages pip install firecrawl-py python-dotenv pydantic ``` 2. Create a `.env` file to safely store your API key: ```bash # Create the file and add your API key echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your-key-here'\" >> .env # Create a .gitignore file to keep your API key private echo \".env\" >> .gitignore ``` 3. Create a simple Python script to test the setup: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv from pydantic import BaseModel # Load your API key load_dotenv() # Create a Firecrawl app instance app = FirecrawlApp() # Create a Pydantic model class PageData(BaseModel): title: str trusted_companies: list[str] # Test the connection result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://firecrawl.dev\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Extract the contents of the page based on the schema provided.\", \"schema\": PageData.model_json_schema(), }, ) ``` ```python print(result['data']) ``` ```python { 'title': 'Turn websites into _LLM-ready_ data', 'trusted_companies': [\\ 'Zapier', 'Gamma',\\ 'Nvidia', 'PHMG',\\ 'StackAI', 'Teller.io',\\ 'Carrefour', 'Vendr',\\ 'OpenGov.sg', 'CyberAgent',\\ 'Continue.dev', 'Bain',\\ 'JasperAI', 'Palladium Digital',\\ 'Checkr', 'JetBrains',\\ 'You.com'\\ ] } ``` First, we import the necessary libraries: - `FirecrawlApp`: The main class for interacting with Firecrawl’s API - `load_dotenv`: For loading environment variables from the `.env` file - `BaseModel` from `pydantic`: For creating data schemas After loading the API key from the `.env` file, we create a `FirecrawlApp` instance which will handle our API requests. We then define a `PageData` class using Pydantic that specifies the structure of data we want to extract: - `title`: A string field for the page title - `trusted_companies`: A list of strings for company names Finally, we make an API call using `app.extract()` with: - A URL to scrape ( `firecrawl.dev`) - Parameters including: - A prompt telling the AI what to extract - The schema converted to JSON format The result will contain the extracted data matching our `PageData` schema structure. That’s all you need to start using the extract endpoint! In the next section, we’ll look at different ways to extract data and how to get exactly the information you need. ## Basic Extraction Patterns Let’s start with some common patterns for extracting data using Firecrawl. ### Using Nested Schemas Let’s look at how to extract more complex data using nested schemas. These are like folders within folders - they help organize related information together. ```python from pydantic import BaseModel from typing import Optional, List # Define a schema for author information class Author(BaseModel): name: str bio: Optional[str] social_links: List[str] # Define a schema for blog posts class BlogPost(BaseModel): title: str author: Author publish_date: str content_summary: str # Use the nested schema with Firecrawl result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://example-blog.com/post/1\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Extract the blog post information including author details\", \"schema\": BlogPost.model_json_schema() } ) ``` This code will give you organized data like this inside `result['data']`: ```python { 'title': 'How to Make Great Pizza', 'author': { 'name': 'Chef Maria', 'bio': 'Professional chef with 15 years experience', 'social_links': ['https://twitter.com/chefmaria', 'https://instagram.com/chefmaria'] }, 'publish_date': '2024-01-15', 'content_summary': 'A detailed guide to making restaurant-quality pizza at home' } ``` Now that we’ve seen how to extract structured data from a single page, let’s look at how to handle multiple items. ### Capturing multiple items of the same type Firecrawl follows your Pydantic schema definition to the letter. This can lead to interesting scenarios like below: ```python class Car(BaseModel): make: str brand: Author manufacture_date: str mileage: int ``` If you use the above schema for scraping a car dealership website, you will only get a single car in the result. To get multiple cars, you need to wrap your schema in a container class: ```python class Inventory(BaseModel): cars: List[Car] result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://cardealership.com/inventory\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Extract the full inventory including all cars and metadata\", \"schema\": Inventory.model_json_schema() } ) ``` This will give you organized data with multiple cars in a structured array. ### Processing Entire Websites When you want to get data from an entire website, you can use the `/*` pattern. This tells Firecrawl to look at all pages on the website. ```python class ProductInfo(BaseModel): name: str price: float description: str in_stock: bool # This will check all pages on the website result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://example-store.com/*\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Find all product information on the website\", \"schema\": ProductInfo.model_json_schema() } ) ``` Remember that using `/*` will process multiple pages, so it will use more credits and thus, output more tokens. Currently, large-scale site coverage is not supported for massive websites like Amazon, eBay or Airbnb. Also, complex logical questions like find all comments made between 10am-12pm in 2011 are not yet fully operational. Since `extract` endpoint is still in Beta, features and performance will continue to evolve. ### Making Your Extractions Better Here are some real examples of how to get better results: ```python # Bad prompt result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://store.com\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Get prices\", # Too vague! \"schema\": ProductInfo.model_json_schema() } ) # Good prompt result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://store.com\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Find all product prices in USD, including any sale prices. If there's a range, get the lowest price.\", # Clear and specific \"schema\": ProductInfo.model_json_schema() } ) ``` Pro Tips: 1. Start with one or two URLs to test your schema and prompt 2. Use clear field names in your schemas (like `product_name` instead of just `name`) 3. Break complex data into smaller, nested schemas 4. Add descriptions to your schema fields to help the AI understand what to look for In the next section, we’ll explore best practices for schema definition, including how to create advanced Pydantic models, design effective schemas, improve extraction accuracy with field descriptions, and see complex schema examples in action. ## Advanced Extraction Patterns Let’s look at a couple of advanced patterns for extracting data effectively from different types of websites. ### Asynchronous Extraction In practice, you will usually scrape dozens if not hundreds of URLs with `extract`. For these larger jobs, you can use `async_extract` which processes URLs concurrently, significantly reducing the total execution time. This asynchronous version returns the same results as `extract` but can be up to 10x faster when processing multiple URLs. Simply use `app.async_extract()` instead of `app.extract()` and the async version returns a job object with status and progress information that you can use to track the extraction progress. This allows your program to continue executing other tasks while the extraction runs in the background, rather than blocking until completion. ```python class HackerNewsArticle(BaseModel): title: str = Field(description=\"The title of the article\") url: Optional[str] = Field(description=\"The URL of the article if present\") points: int = Field(description=\"Number of upvotes/points\") author: str = Field(description=\"Username of the submitter\") comments_count: int = Field(description=\"Number of comments on the post\") posted_time: str = Field(description=\"When the article was posted\") class HackerNewsResponse(BaseModel): articles: List[HackerNewsArticle] extract_job = app.async_extract( urls=[\\ \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\",\\ # your other URLs here ...\\ ], params={ \"schema\": HackerNewsResponse.model_json_schema(), \"prompt\": \"\"\" Extract articles from the Hacker News front page. Each article should include: - The title of the post - The linked URL (if present) - Number of points/upvotes - Username of who posted it - Number of comments - When it was posted \"\"\"} ) ``` Let’s break down what’s happening above: 1. First, we define a `HackerNewsArticle` Pydantic model that specifies the structure for each article: - `title`: The article’s headline - `url`: The link to the full article (optional) - `points`: Number of upvotes - `author`: Username who posted it - `comments_count`: Number of comments - `posted_time`: When it was posted 2. We then create a `HackerNewsResponse` model that contains a list of these articles. 3. Instead of using the synchronous `extract()`, we use `async_extract()`. 4. The extraction job is configured with: - A list of URLs to process (in this case, the Hacker News homepage) - Parameters including our schema and a prompt that guides the AI in extracting the correct information This approach is particularly useful when you need to scrape multiple pages, as it prevents your application from blocking while waiting for each URL to be processed sequentially. `async_extract` returns an extraction job object that includes a `job_id`. You can periodically pass this job ID to `get_extract_status` method to check on the job’s progress: ```python job_status = app.get_extract_status(extract_job.job_id) print(job_status) { \"status\": \"pending\", \"progress\": 36, \"results\": [{\\ \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\",\\ \"data\": { ... }\\ }] } ``` Possible states include: - `completed`: The extraction finished successfully. - `pending`: Firecrawl is still processing your request. - `failed`: An error occurred; data was not fully extracted. - `cancelled`: The job was cancelled by the user. A completed output of `async_extract` will be the same as plain `extract` with additional `status` of `completed` key-value pair. ### Using Web Search Another powerful feature of the extract endpoint is the ability to search the related pages to the URL you are scraping for additional information. For example, let’s say we are scraping GitHub’s trending page and we want to get the following information: ```python class GithubRepository(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"The name of the repository\") url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the repository\") stars: int = Field(description=\"Number of stars/favorites\") license: str = Field(description=\"The open-source license of the repository\") n_releases: str = Field(description=\"The number of releases of the repo if any\") class GithubTrendingResponse(BaseModel): repositories: List[GithubRepository] ``` If you look at the GitHub trending page, you will see that the first page doesn’t contain any information about the license or number of releases. Those pieces of info are on each repository’s page. To get this information, we can set the `enableWebSearch` parameter in the `extract` endpoint. This parameter will search the related pages to the URL you are scraping for additional information. ```python data = app.extract( urls=[\"https://github.com/trending\"], params={ \"schema\": GithubTrendingResponse.model_json_schema(), \"prompt\": \"Extract information based on the schema provided. If there are missing fields, search the related pages for the missing information.\", \"enableWebSearch\": True, }, ) data['data']['repositories'][0] ``` ```python { 'url': 'https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp', 'name': 'YT-DLP', 'license': 'Unlicense license', 'n_stars': 98854, 'n_releases': '103' } ``` The web search feature is particularly powerful when you need to gather comprehensive information that might be spread across multiple pages, saving you from having to write complex crawling logic or multiple extraction calls. ## Best Practices For Schema Definition When designing schemas for the extract endpoint, following these best practices will help you get better, more reliable results: ### 1\\. Start simple, then expand ```python # Start with basic fields class Product(BaseModel): name: str price: float # Then gradually add complexity class Product(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"Full product name including brand\") price: float = Field(description=\"Current price in USD\") variants: List[str] = Field(description=\"List of variants of the product\") specifications: str = Field(description=\"Specifications of the product\") ``` The simple schema focuses on just the essential fields (name and price) which is great for: - Initial testing and validation - Cases where you only need basic product information - Faster development and debugging The complex schema adds more detailed fields and descriptions which helps when: - You need comprehensive product data - The source pages have varied formats - You want to ensure consistent data quality - You need specific variants or specifications By starting simple and expanding gradually, you can validate your extraction works before adding complexity. The field descriptions in the complex schema also help guide the AI to extract the right information in the right format. ### 2\\. Use clear, descriptive field names and types ```python # Poor naming and typing class BadSchema(BaseModel): n: str # Unclear name p: float # Unclear name data: Any # Too flexible # Better naming and typing class GoodSchema(BaseModel): product_name: str price_usd: float technical_specifications: str ``` Use type hints that match your expected data. This helps both the AI model and other developers understand your schema. The only exception is that Firecrawl doesn’t support a `datetime` data type, so if you are scraping temporal information, use `str`. ### 3\\. Structure Complex Data Hierarchically ```python class Author(BaseModel): name: str bio: Optional[str] social_links: List[str] class Article(BaseModel): title: str author: Author content: str tags: List[str] class Blog(BaseModel): articles: List[Article] site_name: str last_updated: datetime ``` Breaking down complex data into nested models makes the schema more maintainable and helps the AI understand relationships between data points. In the above example, the `Blog` model contains a list of `Article` objects, which in turn contain `Author` objects. This hierarchical structure clearly shows how the data is organized - a blog has many articles, and each article has one author with their own properties. ### 4\\. Include Example Data ```python class ProductReview(BaseModel): rating: int = Field( description=\"Customer rating from 1-5 stars\" ) comment: str reviewer_name: str verified_purchase: bool class Config: json_schema_extra = { \"example\": { \"rating\": 4, \"comment\": \"Great product, fast shipping!\", \"reviewer_name\": \"John D.\", \"verified_purchase\": True } } ``` Providing examples in your schema helps the AI understand exactly what format you expect, especially for complex or ambiguous fields. Pro tips: - Use `Optional` fields when data might not always be present - Include unit information in field descriptions (e.g., “price in USD”, “weight in kg”) - Use enums for fields with a fixed set of possible values ## A Real-World Example: Scraping GitHub Trending Repositories Let’s build a complete example that extracts trending repository data from [GitHub’s trending page](https://github.com/trending). This example will show how to: 1. Design a robust schema 2. Handle nested data 3. Process multiple items 4. Use field descriptions effectively Let’s start by making fresh imports and setup: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from typing import List, Optional from datetime import datetime import os from dotenv import load_dotenv # Load environment variables load_dotenv() # Initialize Firecrawl app = FirecrawlApp() ``` Now, let’s define our nested schema for the data: ```python class Developer(BaseModel): username: str = Field(description=\"GitHub username of the developer\") profile_url: str = Field(description=\"URL to the developer's GitHub profile\") class Repository(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"Repository name in format 'username/repo'\") description: Optional[str] = Field( description=\"Repository description if available\" ) url: str = Field(description=\"Full URL to the repository\") language: Optional[str] = Field(description=\"Primary programming language used\") stars: int = Field(description=\"Total number of stars\") forks: int = Field(description=\"Total number of forks\") stars_today: int = Field(description=\"Number of stars gained today\") developers: List[Developer] = Field( default_factory=list, description=\"List of contributors to the repository\" ) class TrendingData(BaseModel): repositories: List[Repository] = Field(description=\"List of trending repositories\") ``` The schema above defines three Pydantic models for structured GitHub trending data: - `Developer`: Represents a contributor with their GitHub username and profile URL - `Repository`: Contains details about a GitHub repo including name, description, URL, language, stars count, forks count, stars gained today, and a list of contributors - `TrendingData`: The root model that contains a list of trending repositories Next, let’s define a function for running a scraper using our schema: ```python def scrape_trending_repos(): # Extract the data result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://github.com/trending\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"\"\" Extract information about trending GitHub repositories. For each repository: - Get the full repository name (username/repo) - Get the description if available - Extract the primary programming language - Get the total stars and forks - Get the number of stars gained today - Get information about contributors including their usernames and profile URLs Note: - Stars and forks should be converted to numbers (e.g., '1.2k' → 1200) - Stars today should be extracted from the \"X stars today\" text - Ensure all URLs are complete (add https://github.com if needed) \"\"\", \"schema\": TrendingData.model_json_schema() } ) return result ``` Now, let’s print the details of some of the scraped repos: ```python # Process and display the results if result[\"success\"]: trending = TrendingData(**result[\"data\"]) # Print the top 3 repositories print(\"🔥 Top 3 Trending Repositories:\") for repo in trending.repositories[:3]: print(f\"\\n📦 {repo.name}\") print(f\"📝 {repo.description[:100]}...\" if repo.description else \"No description\") print(f\"🌟 {repo.stars:,} total stars ({repo.stars_today:,} today)\") print(f\"🔤 {repo.language or 'Unknown language'}\") print(f\"🔗 {repo.url}\") ``` Example output: ```bash 🔥 Top 3 Trending Repositories: 📦 microsoft/garnet 📝 Garnet: A Remote Cache-Store for Distributed Applications... 🌟 12,483 total stars (1,245 today) 🔤 C# 🔗 https://github.com/microsoft/garnet 📦 openai/whisper 📝 Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision... 🌟 54,321 total stars (523 today) 🔤 Python 🔗 https://github.com/openai/whisper 📦 lencx/ChatGPT 📝 ChatGPT Desktop Application (Mac, Windows and Linux)... 🌟 43,210 total stars (342 today) 🔤 TypeScript 🔗 https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT ``` This example demonstrates several best practices: 1. **Nested Models**: Using separate models for repositories and developers 2. **Smart Defaults**: Using `default_factory` for lists and timestamps 3. **Clear Descriptions**: Each field has a detailed description 4. **Type Safety**: Using proper types like `HttpUrl` for URLs 5. **Detailed Prompt**: The prompt clearly explains how to handle special cases You can extend this example by: - Adding time period filtering (daily, weekly, monthly) - Including more repository metadata - Saving results to a database - Setting up automated daily tracking - Adding error handling and retries ## Extract vs Other Endpoints Firecrawl offers three main endpoints for gathering web data: `/extract`, `/scrape`, and `/crawl`. Each serves different use cases and has unique strengths. Let’s explore when to use each one. ### Extract vs Scrape The `/scrape` endpoint is best for: - Single-page detailed extraction - Getting multiple output formats (HTML, markdown, screenshots) - JavaScript-heavy websites requiring browser rendering - Capturing visual elements or taking screenshots ```python # Scrape endpoint example - multiple formats result = app.scrape_url( \"https://example.com\", params={ \"formats\": [\"html\", \"markdown\", \"screenshot\", \"extract\"], \"extract\": { \"schema\": MySchema.model_json_schema(), \"prompt\": \"Extract product information\" } } ) ``` The `/extract` endpoint is better for: - Processing multiple URLs efficiently - Website-wide data extraction - Complex structured data extraction - Building data enrichment pipelines ```python # Extract endpoint example - multiple URLs result = app.extract( urls=[\"https://example.com/*\"], params={ \"prompt\": \"Extract all product information\", \"schema\": ProductSchema.model_json_schema() } ) ``` Note that the _extract_ functionality is built into the `scrape_url` function and usually returns identical structured results like `extract`. The difference is that `scrape_url` is designed for single pages or when other extraction options are required. ### Extract vs Crawl The `/crawl` endpoint excels at: - Discovering and following links automatically - Complete website archiving - Sitemap generation - Sequential page processing ```python # Crawl endpoint example result = app.crawl_url( \"https://example.com\", params={ \"limit\": 5, \"includePaths\": [\"/blog/.+\"], \"excludePaths\": [\"/author/.+\"], \"scrapeOptions\": { \"formats\": [\"markdown\", \"html\"], \"includeTags\": [\"code\", \"#page-header\"], \"excludeTags\": [\"h1\", \"h2\", \".main-content\"] } } ) ``` The `/extract` endpoint is preferable when: - You know exactly which URLs to process - You need specific structured data from known pages - You want parallel processing of multiple URLs ### Choosing the Right Endpoint Here’s a decision framework for choosing between endpoints: 1. **Use `/extract` when:** - You need structured data from known URLs - You want to process multiple pages in parallel - You need to combine data from different websites - You have a specific schema for the data you want 2. **Use `/scrape` when:** - You need multiple output formats - The website requires JavaScript rendering - You need screenshots or visual elements - You’re dealing with single pages that need detailed extraction 3. **Use `/crawl` when:** - You need to discover pages automatically - You want to archive entire websites - You need to follow specific URL patterns - You’re building a complete site map Ultimately, the extraction functionality is built into all endpoints, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for your specific use case while maintaining consistent data extraction capabilities. Reference our detailed guides for more information: - [Mastering the Scrape Endpoint](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint) - [Complete Crawl Endpoint Guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-the-crawl-endpoint-in-firecrawl) ## Conclusion The `/extract` endpoint combines AI-driven understanding with structured data validation to solve common web scraping challenges. Instead of maintaining brittle HTML selectors or writing custom parsing logic, developers can describe their data needs in plain English while ensuring consistent output through schema validation. This approach works particularly well for projects that need to gather structured data from multiple sources or websites that frequently change their layouts. For those new to the endpoint, we recommend starting with simple schemas and single URLs before tackling more complex extractions. This helps in understanding how the AI interprets your prompts and how different schema designs affect the extraction results.

We’ll cover: - Multi-agent role-playing task setup - Web scraping implementation - Knowledge graph construction - Agent monitoring techniques To demonstrate these concepts, we’ll build a knowledge graph to analyze Yusuf Dikec’s performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. [The notebook version is here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Rhl5U3av0-tBZzhh45P0FuuJ7r62L4mw?authuser=1#scrollTo=dD7p_9CkyUmK). ## 🐫 Setting Up CAMEL and Firecrawl To get started, install the CAMEL package with all its dependencies: ``` pip install camel-ai[all]==0.1.6.3 ``` Next, set up your API keys for Firecrawl and OpenAI to enable interaction with external services. ## API Keys You’ll need to set up your API keys for both Firecrawl and OpenAI. This ensures that the tools can interact with external services securely. Your can go to here to get free API Key from Firecrawl ``` import os from getpass import getpass # Prompt for the Firecrawl API key securely firecrawl_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ') os.environ[\"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\"] = firecrawl_api_key openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ') os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = openai_api_key ``` ## 🌐 Effortless Web Scraping with Firecrawl Firecrawl simplifies web scraping and cleaning content from web pages. Here’s an example of scraping content from a specific post on the CAMEL AI website: ```python from camel.loaders import Firecrawl firecrawl = Firecrawl() response = firecrawl.tidy_scrape( url=\"https://www.camel-ai.org/post/crab\" ) print(response) ``` ## 🛠️ Web Information Retrieval using CAMEL’s RAG and Firecrawl Let’s retrieve relevant information from a list of URLs using CAMEL’s RAG model. We’ll define a function that uses Firecrawl for web scraping and CAMEL’s AutoRetriever for retrieving the most relevant information based on a query: ```python from camel.configs import ChatGPTConfig from camel.models import ModelFactory from camel.retrievers import AutoRetriever from camel.toolkits import OpenAIFunction, SearchToolkit from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType, StorageType def retrieve_information_from_urls(urls: list[str], query: str) -> str: r\"\"\"Retrieves relevant information from a list of URLs based on a given query. This function uses the `Firecrawl` tool to scrape content from the provided URLs and then uses the `AutoRetriever` from CAMEL to retrieve the most relevant information based on the query from the scraped content. Args: urls (list[str]): A list of URLs to scrape content from. query (str): The query string to search for relevant information. Returns: str: The most relevant information retrieved based on the query. Example: >>> urls = [\"https://example.com/article1\", \"https://example.com/\\ article2\"] >>> query = \"latest advancements in AI\" >>> result = retrieve_information_from_urls(urls, query) \"\"\" aggregated_content = '' # Scrape and aggregate content from each URL for url in urls: scraped_content = Firecrawl().tidy_scrape(url) aggregated_content += scraped_content # Initialize the AutoRetriever for retrieving relevant content auto_retriever = AutoRetriever( vector_storage_local_path=\"local_data\", storage_type=StorageType.QDRANT ) # Retrieve the most relevant information based on the query # You can adjust the top_k and similarity_threshold value based on your needs retrieved_info = auto_retriever.run_vector_retriever( query=query, contents=aggregated_content, top_k=3, similarity_threshold=0.5, ) return retrieved_info ``` Let’s put the retrieval function to the test by gathering some information about the 2024 Olympics. The first run may take about 50 seconds as it needs to build a local vector database ```python retrieved_info = retrieve_information_from_urls( query=\"Which country won the most golden prize in 2024 Olympics?\", urls=[\\ \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics\",\\ \"https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024\",\\ ], ) print(retrieved_info) ``` 🎉 Thanks to CAMEL’s RAG pipeline and Firecrawl’s tidy scraping capabilities, this function effectively retrieves relevant information from the specified URLs! You can now integrate this function into CAMEL’s Agents to automate the retrieval process further. ## 📹 Monitoring AI Agents with AgentOps AgentOps is a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing the execution of CAMEL agents. To set up AgentOps, obtain an API key and configure it in your environment: ```python import os from getpass import getpass agentops_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ') os.environ[\"AGENTOPS_API_KEY\"] = agentops_api_key import agentops agentops.init(default_tags=[\"CAMEL\"]) ``` With AgentOps set up, you can monitor and analyze the execution of your CAMEL agents, gaining valuable insights into their performance and behavior. ## 🧠 Constructing Knowledge Graphs CAMEL can build and store knowledge graphs from text data, enabling advanced analysis and visualization of relationships. Here’s how to set up a Neo4j instance and define a function to create a knowledge graph: ```python from camel.storages import Neo4jGraph from camel.loaders import UnstructuredIO from camel.agents import KnowledgeGraphAgent from camel.storages import Neo4jGraph from camel.loaders import UnstructuredIO from camel.agents import KnowledgeGraphAgent def knowledge_graph_builder(text_input: str) -> None: r\"\"\"Build and store a knowledge graph from the provided text. This function processes the input text to create and extract nodes and relationships, which are then added to a Neo4j database as a knowledge graph. Args: text_input (str): The input text from which the knowledge graph is to be constructed. Returns: graph_elements: The generated graph element from knowlegde graph agent. \"\"\" # Set Neo4j instance n4j = Neo4jGraph( url=\"Your_URI\", username=\"Your_Username\", password=\"Your_Password\", ) # Initialize instances uio = UnstructuredIO() kg_agent = KnowledgeGraphAgent() # Create an element from the provided text element_example = uio.create_element_from_text(text_input, element_id=\"001\") # Extract nodes and relationships using the Knowledge Graph Agent graph_elements = kg_agent.run(element_example, parse_graph_elements=True) # Add the extracted graph elements to the Neo4j database n4j.add_graph_elements(graph_elements=[graph_elements]) return graph_elements ``` ## 🤖🤖 Multi-Agent Role-Playing with CAMEL CAMEL enables role-playing sessions where AI agents interact to accomplish tasks using various tools. Let’s guide an assistant agent to perform a comprehensive study of the Turkish shooter in the 2024 Paris Olympics: 1. Define the task prompt. 2. Configure the assistant agent with tools for web information retrieval and knowledge graph building. 3. Initialize the role-playing session. 4. Start the interaction between agents. ```python from typing import List from colorama import Fore from camel.agents.chat_agent import FunctionCallingRecord from camel.societies import RolePlaying from camel.utils import print_text_animated from camel.societies import RolePlaying task_prompt = \"\"\"Do a comprehensive study of the Turkish shooter in 2024 paris olympics, write a report for me, then create a knowledge graph for the report. You should use search tool to get related urls first, then use retrieval tool to get the retrieved content back, finally use tool to create the knowledge graph to finish the task.\"\"\" retrieval_tool = OpenAIFunction(retrieve_information_from_urls) search_tool = OpenAIFunction(SearchToolkit().search_duckduckgo) knowledge_graph_tool = OpenAIFunction(knowledge_graph_builder) tool_list = [\\ retrieval_tool,\\ search_tool,\\ knowledge_graph_tool,\\ ] assistant_model_config = ChatGPTConfig( tools=tool_list, temperature=0.0, ) role_play_session = RolePlaying( assistant_role_name=\"CAMEL Assistant\", user_role_name=\"CAMEL User\", assistant_agent_kwargs=dict( model=ModelFactory.create( model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI, model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O, model_config_dict=assistant_model_config.as_dict(), ), tools=tool_list, ), user_agent_kwargs=dict(), task_prompt=task_prompt, with_task_specify=False, ) input_msg = role_play_session.init_chat() while n < 10: n += 1 assistant_response, user_response = role_play_session.step(input_msg) if \"CAMEL_TASK_DONE\" in user_response.msg.content: break input_msg = assistant_response.msg ``` Now we can set up the role playing session with this: ```python # Initialize the role-playing session role_play_session = RolePlaying( assistant_role_name=\"CAMEL Assistant\", user_role_name=\"CAMEL User\", assistant_agent_kwargs=dict( model=ModelFactory.create( model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI, model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI, model_config_dict=assistant_model_config.as_dict(), ), tools=tool_list, ), user_agent_kwargs=dict(), task_prompt=task_prompt, with_task_specify=False, ) ``` Print the system message and task prompt like this: ```python print( Fore.GREEN + f\"AI Assistant sys message:\\n{role_play_session.assistant_sys_msg}\\n\" ) print(Fore.BLUE + f\"AI User sys message:\\n{role_play_session.user_sys_msg}\\n\") print(Fore.YELLOW + f\"Original task prompt:\\n{task_prompt}\\n\") print( Fore.CYAN + \"Specified task prompt:\" + f\"\\n{role_play_session.specified_task_prompt}\\n\" ) print(Fore.RED + f\"Final task prompt:\\n{role_play_session.task_prompt}\\n\") ``` Set the termination rule and start the interaction between agents: NOTE: This session will take approximately 5 minutes and will consume around $0.02 in tokens by using GPT4o-mini. ```python n = 0 input_msg = role_play_session.init_chat() while n < 10: # Limit the chat to 10 turns n += 1 assistant_response, user_response = role_play_session.step(input_msg) if assistant_response.terminated: print( Fore.GREEN + ( \"AI Assistant terminated. Reason: \" f\"{assistant_response.info['termination_reasons']}.\" ) ) break if user_response.terminated: print( Fore.GREEN + ( \"AI User terminated. \" f\"Reason: {user_response.info['termination_reasons']}.\" ) ) break # Print output from the user print_text_animated( Fore.BLUE + f\"AI User:\\n\\n{user_response.msg.content}\\n\", 0.01 ) # Print output from the assistant, including any function # execution information print_text_animated(Fore.GREEN + \"AI Assistant:\", 0.01) tool_calls: List[FunctionCallingRecord] = [\\ FunctionCallingRecord(**call.as_dict())\\ for call in assistant_response.info['tool_calls']\\ ] for func_record in tool_calls: print_text_animated(f\"{func_record}\", 0.01) print_text_animated(f\"{assistant_response.msg.content}\\n\", 0.01) if \"CAMEL_TASK_DONE\" in user_response.msg.content: break input_msg = assistant_response.msg ``` End the AgentOps Session like so: ```python # End the AgentOps session agentops.end_session(\"Success\") ``` ## 🌟 Highlights This blog demonstrates the power of CAMEL and Firecrawl for Advanced RAG with Knowledge Graphs.

According to [a report published by Markets And Markets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html), the global agent market is projected to reach almost $8 billion in 2025, with compound annual growth rate (CAGR) reaching 46% in 2030. This rapid growth is fueled by stronger and stronger foundational LLMs that seem to come out every week now. For this reason, choosing appropriate frameworks to build AI agents has become essential if developers want to integrate existing infrastructure with language models. In this article, we will examine the most powerful and widely adopted open source frameworks to build agents in 2025, analyzing their technical features, implementation requirements and optimal use cases. ## Our Evaluation Methodology to Filter Agent Frameworks To find the best agent frameworks, we used clear metrics and practical requirements. We gathered data from GitHub, PyPI downloads, documentation, and industry articles, looking for frameworks that can handle reasoning tasks, work together as multiple agents, and use tools effectively. We evaluated each framework based on: - **GitHub metrics**: Stars, active contributors, and regular updates - **Adoption**: Monthly download numbers - **Technical features**: Ability to reason, collaborate between agents, and use tools - **Documentation**: Clear guides and tutorials for developers - **Real-world use**: Proven cases in actual production environments - **Industry use**: How they work across different sectors like finance and customer service - **Backing organizations**: Support from established companies for ongoing development The six frameworks we selected show real value based on these criteria and provide solid options for developers building AI agents in 2025. ## Firecrawl: The Best Data Collection Agent Before we dive into our list of best agentic frameworks, let’s talk about Firecrawl’s FIRE-1, a web interaction agent that enables automated navigation through complex websites. Released during Launch Week III, FIRE-1 extends traditional web scraping by handling dynamic content and multi-step processes. This capability bridges the gap between simple data collection and sophisticated web interaction needed for comprehensive data gathering. FIRE-1 offers several capabilities that make it valuable for data collection: - **Intelligent Navigation**: Moves through paginated content and multi-step processes - **Dynamic Interaction**: [Interacts with buttons, links, inputs, and other UI elements](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agents/fire-1#what-fire-1-can-do) - **Multi-Page Data Collection**: [Retrieves information across pages](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agents/fire-1#using-fire-1-with-the-extract-endpoint) requiring navigation - **Action Planning**: Plans sequences of interactions to access specific data - **Integration with Extraction**: Works with the [/extract endpoint](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/extract) to produce structured data Here’s a straightforward example of using FIRE-1 to navigate through product listings: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"fc-7624851950b5492d8193765f03842352\") # Use FIRE-1 to navigate through Y Combinator company listings scrape_result = app.scrape_url( 'https://www.ycombinator.com/companies', { \"formats\": ['markdown', 'html'], \"agent\": { 'model': 'FIRE-1', 'prompt': 'Click on the W22 batch button, then click on Consumer category, and collect the company information.' } } ) ``` ```python print(scrape_result['markdown']) ``` Firecrawl provides additional tools that can enhance agent capabilities. The [LLMs.txt API](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/alpha/llmstxt) converts websites to clean text format for LLMs, the [/extract endpoint](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/extract) retrieves structured data, and the [Deep Research API](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/alpha/deep-research) conducts comprehensive web research. These components can be integrated as tools within agent frameworks to enable robust data collection capabilities. ## Top 6 Open Source Frameworks to Build AI Agents Now, without further ado, here are the six most effective open source frameworks for building AI agents in 2025, ranked by their proven success in real-world applications and developer adoption. ### 1\\.

Therefore, we are summarizing key insights shared by OpenAI, Anthropic and McKinsey into these 10 tangible best practices: 01. Select the appropriate agent type for your specific use case. Carefully evaluate whether you need copilot agents for individual productivity, workflow automation platforms, domain-specific agents, or AI virtual workers. 02. Deploy agent systems rather than isolated agents. Complex tasks benefit from specialized sub-agents working in coordination where manager agents break down workflows and assign subtasks. 03. Implement the four-step agent workflow: user task assignment, planning and work allocation, iterative output improvement, and action execution. 04. Build constructive feedback loops where agents can review and refine their work before final delivery, improving output quality. 05. Implement collaborative review processes by designing specialist “critic” agents that can review the work of “creator” agents and request iterations. 06. Prioritize accuracy verification with architectures that check for errors or hallucinations before sharing responses with users. 07. Center human values in ethical decisions, ensuring they’re rooted in organizational and societal values that place humans at the center of the AI ecosystem. 08. Use agents for unpredictable situations where rule-based systems would fail, leveraging their foundation in large, unstructured data sets. 09. Set clear performance metrics to assess agent impact, such as issue resolution rates, handling time, and productivity improvements. 10. Anticipate value beyond automation by looking at broader benefits like process reimagining and IT infrastructure modernization. These practices help bridge the gap between technical capabilities and practical business value in AI agent implementations.

As these models continue to evolve, DeepSeek R1 has emerged as a promising open-source alternative that offers impressive capabilities while maintaining accessibility for developers and researchers. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll walk through the process of fine-tuning DeepSeek R1 using custom instruction datasets. Whether you’re looking to enhance the model’s performance for specialized tasks or adapt it to your domain-specific needs, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and practical steps to successfully fine-tune DeepSeek R1. ## DeepSeek R1 Distilled Models The DeepSeek R1 model contains over 600 billion parameters and requires data centers costing more than my house to run and fine-tune. To make the model more accessible, DeepSeek AI offers smaller alternatives through distilled versions. These distilled versions are created through a process where the full model acts as a “teacher” guiding smaller “student” models. By transferring knowledge from the larger DeepSeek-R1 teacher model, more efficient student models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama can be created, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters. This allows the smaller models to capture the reasoning capabilities of the full model (to a certain extent) while being much more practical to run and deploy. In this tutorial, we will focus on its [Llama-3.1 version with 8B parameters](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) as it is the most practical version to run on consumer hardware or on free cloud services like Kaggle or Google Colab Pro (we will use Kaggle). ## How to Find a Dataset For Fine-tuning DeepSeek? Finding the right dataset is crucial for successful fine-tuning of any language model, including DeepSeek R1. The dataset should align with your intended use case and contain high-quality examples that demonstrate the behavior you want the model to learn. Here are key considerations when selecting or creating a dataset for fine-tuning: 1. **Relevance**: The dataset should closely match your target use case 2. **Quality**: Data should be clean, well-formatted, and free of errors 3. **Size**: While bigger isn’t always better, aim for at least a few thousand examples 4. **Diversity**: Include various examples covering different aspects of the desired behavior 5. **Format**: Data should follow a consistent instruction-response format ### Public datasets There are already hundreds of high-quality open-source datasets to fine-tune reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. For example, by searching “cot” (chain-of-thought) datasets on HuggingFace Hub, you will get close to 1000 results: ### Custom datasets Despite the high availability of public datasets, there are many scenarios where you might need to create your own datasets to fine-tune models for specific tasks or domains. Here are approaches to build custom datasets: 1. **Manual creation**: - Write your own instruction-response pairs - Most time-consuming but highest quality control - Ideal for specialized domains 2. **Semi-automated generation**: - Use existing LLMs to generate initial examples - Human review and editing for quality - Faster than manual creation while maintaining quality 3. **Data collection**: - Convert existing documentation or Q&A pairs - Extract from customer interactions - Transform domain-specific content into instruction format Whichever approach you choose, you will need a web scraping solution to curate initial raw data. This is where [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) comes in. Firecrawl provides web scraping and crawling capabilities through an API interface. Rather than using CSS selectors or XPath expressions which can break when websites change, it uses AI-powered extraction to identify and collect data using natural language descriptions. It can also convert entire websites into collections of markdown documents, which is an ideal format to generate high-quality datasets for LLMs. In our [previous article on creating custom instruction datasets](https://firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning), we showed how to build a training dataset focused on Firecrawl’s API. We used Firecrawl itself to crawl its own [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/) and [blog posts](https://firecrawl.dev/blog), then processed those pages into structured data. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated instruction-answer pairs that covered various aspects of the API functionality. Now in this article, we’ll use that same dataset to fine-tune DeepSeek R1 8B, teaching it to accurately answer questions about Firecrawl. ### Effect of dataset size over model performance Before we dive into the code for fine-tuning DeepSeek R1, let’s briefly discuss the effect of dataset size over model performance, which isn’t always linear. Here are key insights: 1. **Minimum viable size**: - Start with at least 1,000-2,000 examples - Quality matters more than quantity - Smaller, high-quality datasets often outperform larger, noisy ones 2. **Diminishing returns**: - Performance improvements tend to plateau - 10,000-50,000 examples is often sufficient - Beyond this, focus on diversity and quality 3. **Quality vs. quantity**: - A few hundred excellent examples > thousands of mediocre ones - Balance between coverage and redundancy - Consider computational costs of larger datasets Remember: The optimal dataset size depends on your specific use case, available computing resources, and desired model performance. ## The Tech Stack For Any Supervised LLM Fine-tuning Task Let’s explore the technical stack needed for implementing fine-tuning. This stack is versatile enough to be used for supervised fine-tuning of any language model. 01. [`unsloth`](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth): A library that optimizes LLM fine-tuning by reducing memory usage and training time. It provides QLoRA and other memory-efficient techniques out of the box. 02. [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub): Enables seamless integration with Hugging Face’s model hub for downloading pre-trained models and uploading fine-tuned ones. Essential for model sharing and versioning. 03. [`datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets): Provides efficient data loading and preprocessing utilities. Handles large datasets through memory mapping and streaming, with built-in support for common ML dataset formats. 04. [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): The core library for working with transformer models. Offers model architectures, tokenizers, and training utilities with a unified API across different model types. 05. [`trl`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl): (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) Specializes in fine-tuning language models through techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). 06. [`torch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch): The deep learning framework that powers the training process. Provides tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and GPU acceleration essential for model training. 07. [`wandb`](https://github.com/wandb/wandb): (Weights & Biases) A powerful experiment tracking tool that monitors training metrics, visualizes results, and helps compare different training runs. Invaluable for debugging and optimization. 08. [`accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate): A library that simplifies distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines. It handles device placement, mixed precision training, and gradient synchronization automatically. 09. [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes): Provides 8-bit optimizers and quantization methods to reduce model memory usage. Essential for training large models on consumer hardware through techniques like Int8 and FP8 quantization. 10. [`peft`](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) Implements memory-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-Tuning. Allows fine-tuning billion-parameter models on consumer GPUs by training only a small subset of parameters. Let’s examine how these libraries work together to enable LLM fine-tuning: The process starts with PyTorch ( `torch`) as the foundation - it provides the core tensor operations and automatic differentiation needed for neural network training. On top of this, the `transformers` library implements the actual model architectures and training logic specific to transformer models like DeepSeek. When loading a pre-trained model, `huggingface_hub` handles downloading the weights and configuration files from Hugging Face’s model repository. The model is then loaded into memory through `transformers`, while `bitsandbytes` applies quantization to reduce the memory footprint. For efficient fine-tuning, `peft` implements parameter-efficient methods like `LoRA` that modify only a small subset of model weights. This works in conjunction with `unsloth`, which further optimizes memory usage and training speed through techniques like `QLoRA`. The `datasets` library manages the training data, using memory mapping to efficiently handle large datasets without loading everything into RAM. It feeds batches of data to the training loop, where `trl` implements the supervised fine-tuning logic. `accelerate` coordinates the training process across available hardware resources, managing device placement and mixed precision training. It works with PyTorch’s built-in distributed training capabilities to enable multi-GPU training when available. Throughout training, `wandb` tracks and visualizes metrics like loss and accuracy in real-time, storing this data for later analysis and comparison between different training runs. This integrated stack allows you to fine-tune billion-parameter models on consumer hardware by: 1. Loading and quantizing the base model efficiently 2. Applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques 3. Managing training data and hardware resources 4. Tracking training progress and results Each component handles a specific aspect of the fine-tuning process while working seamlessly with the others through standardized APIs and data formats. As you continue with the tutorial, you will see most of these libraries used to fine-tune our own DeepSeek R1 model ## Step-by-step Guide to Fine-tuning DeepSeek R1 Now that we have a high-level understanding of the tools we are going to use, let’s see them in action to fine-tune DeepSeek. ### 1\\. Environment setup Since our fine-tuning stack is popular, most of it is already installed inside Kaggle notebooks, which will be our choice of IDE since they provide 30 hours of access to high-quality P100 GPUs. We only need to install `unsloth`: ```bash !pip install -q unsloth !pip install -q --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git ``` The first command installs the stable version from PyPI, while the second command force-installs the latest development version directly from GitHub to ensure we have the most up-to-date optimizations. Next, add your HuggingFace and Weights & Biases tokens as environment secrets. These tokens allow you to authenticate with both services - HuggingFace for accessing and uploading models, and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking. You can find your HuggingFace token in your account settings under “Access Tokens”, and your W&B token in your user settings under “API keys”. Add these as environment variables named `HF_TOKEN` and `WANDB_TOKEN` respectively by going to “Add-ons” > “Secrets” inside your notebook. Afterward, you can setup both services: ```python import wandb from huggingface_hub import login from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient user_secrets = UserSecretsClient() hf_token = user_secrets.get_secret(\"HF_TOKEN\") wb_token = user_secrets.get_secret(\"WANDB_TOKEN\") # Login to both services login(hf_token) wandb.login(key=wb_token) ``` ```python run = wandb.init( project='fine-tune-deepseek-firecrawl', job_type=\"training\", anonymous=\"allow\" ) ``` The `run` object represents our Weights & Biases experiment run. It will track metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts throughout the training process. We set the project name to ‘fine-tune-deepseek-firecrawl’ to organize our experiments, specify this is a training job, and allow anonymous access so others can view our results. That is all the setup we need. ### 2\\. Loading the model and the tokenizer ```python import torch from unsloth import FastLanguageModel model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained( model_name=\"unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B\", max_seq_length=2048, dtype=torch.bfloat16, load_in_4bit=True, token=hf_token ) ``` This code loads a pre-trained DeepSeek model and tokenizer using FastLanguageModel. Let’s break down the parameters: The maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens defines how much context the model can process in a single forward pass, directly impacting both training and inference - longer sequences allow the model to learn from and generate more coherent text by considering more context, but also increase memory usage and training time, while shorter sequences may limit the model’s ability to capture long-range dependencies but train faster and use less memory. `dtype=torch.bfloat16` uses `bfloat16` precision, which reduces memory usage while maintaining numerical stability compared to full `float32`. `load_in_4bit=True` enables 4-bit quantization, dramatically reducing the model’s memory footprint with minimal performance impact. This is crucial for training on limited hardware. `token=hf_token` passes our Hugging Face authentication token to access the model. This is required since we’re using a gated model. The model and tokenizer are returned as a tuple and stored in the respective variables for use in subsequent training steps. Let’s quickly test the model by asking it a question about Firecrawl: ```python from transformers import TextStreamer FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) prompt = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: {} ### Response: {} \"\"\" instruction = \"How do I extract repo name, number of stars, repo link from the https://github.com/trending page using Firecrawl?\" message = prompt.format(instruction, \"\") inputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\") text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) _ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_streamer, max_new_tokens=512, use_cache=True) ``` We first import `TextStreamer` for streaming the model’s output token by token. `FastLanguageModel.for_inference()` prepares the model for inference mode. A prompt template is defined that formats instructions and responses in a specific structure. The instruction asks about using Firecrawl with GitHub’s trending page. The prompt is formatted with the instruction and an empty response string. The tokenizer converts this text into model-readable tokens and moves them to the GPU. A `TextStreamer` instance is created to handle streaming output. Finally, `model.generate()` is called with the tokenized input to produce the response. `max_new_tokens=512` limits the response length, and `use_cache=True` enables caching for faster generation. Here is the output ```plaintext To extract the repository name, star count, and GitHub link from the GitHub Trends page using Firecrawl, you can follow these steps: 1. **Open Firecrawl**: Start by launching the Firecrawl browser extension. 2. **Navigate to GitHub Trends**: Go to the URL https://github.com/trending. 3. **Inspect Element**: Once the page loads, click the Firecrawl icon (the small orange and white火火火 icon) located in your web browser's toolbar. This will open the Firecrawl interface... ``` As you can see, the model generated a totally fabricated response (it thinks Firecrawl is a browser extension), which effectively proves that it doesn’t have prior knowledge of the tool. Let’s switch the model back to training mode before moving on: ```python model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained( model_name=\"unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B\", max_seq_length=2048, dtype=torch.bfloat16, load_in_4bit=True, token=hf_token ) ``` ### 3\\. Preprocessing a dataset Now, let’s load and preprocess our custom Firecrawl dataset uploaded to HuggingFace in [our previous article](https://firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning): ```python from datasets import load_dataset dataset_name = \"bexgboost/firecrawl-instructions\" dataset = load_dataset( dataset_name, split = \"train[0:500]\", trust_remote_code=True ) ``` The custom `firecrawl-instructions` dataset contains over 6k examples, which would be too large a size to process in a Kaggle session. That’s why we are only loading the first 500 examples. Caption: Screenshot of the data card of the custom Firecrawl instructions dataset. Notice how the dataset only contains two columns for the instruction and the answer. To fine-tune reasoning models like DeepSeek R1 (distilled versions as well), the datasets should have one more column for the chain-of-thought: Chain-of-thought reasoning is a critical component for training models to develop better reasoning capabilities. However, since we’re focusing on demonstrating the fine-tuning process in this example, we’ll proceed with our simplified dataset that only contains instructions and answers. In a production environment, you would want to generate the chain-of-thought part and include it to achieve optimal model performance (this requires even more preparation, effort and training resources). After loading the dataset, we need to convert its every sample into a suitable training prompt: ```python EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token def format_instruction(example): prompt = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. Before answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response. ### Instruction: You are a web scraping expert with advanced knowledge in Firecrawl, which is an AI-based web-scraping engine. Please answer the following question about Firecrawl. ### Question: {} ### Response: {}\"\"\" return { \"text\": prompt.format(example['instruction'], example['answer']) + EOS_TOKEN } dataset = dataset.map(format_instruction) ``` The code demonstrates our dataset formatting process for training. We define an `EOS_TOKEN` from our tokenizer to mark sequence endings, then create a `format_instruction()` function that transforms each example into a structured prompt. The prompt template includes clear sections for question, and responses, with specific context about Firecrawl. Using `dataset.map()`, we apply this formatting across our entire dataset, preparing it for the fine-tuning process. Our dataset is now ready for fine-tuning. ### 4\\. Setting up the `SFFTrainer` Now that we have our dataset prepared, let’s set up the `SFFTrainer` for fine-tuning. The `SFFTrainer` is a specialized trainer that implements efficient fine-tuning techniques. We’ll configure it with optimal parameters for our use case. First, we configure the PEFT model with LoRA parameters, specifying target modules and hyperparameters for efficient fine-tuning. ```python model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model( model, r=16, target_modules=[\\ \"q_proj\",\\ \"k_proj\",\\ \"v_proj\",\\ \"o_proj\",\\ \"gate_proj\",\\ \"up_proj\",\\ \"down_proj\",\\ ], lora_alpha=16, lora_dropout=0, bias=\"none\", use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\", # True or \"unsloth\" for very long context random_state=1000, use_rslora=False, loftq_config=None, ) ``` The code above configures Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for training our AI model. This method allows us to efficiently update only specific parts of the model while preserving its existing knowledge. LoRA achieves this by introducing small trainable matrices into key model components. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and accelerates the training process compared to traditional fine-tuning methods. Key parameters explained: - `r=16`: The rank of the LoRA decomposition matrices. Higher values (e.g. 32, 64) increase model capacity and expressiveness but require more memory and compute. Lower values (e.g. 4, 8) are more memory efficient but may limit learning. 16 provides a good balance for most use cases. - `target_modules`: The list of transformer layer components that LoRA will be applied to. This includes attention mechanism components (query, key, value, and output projections) and feed-forward network components (gate, up, and down projections). By targeting these specific modules, we can efficiently update the most important parts of the model while keeping other parameters frozen. The attention components control how the model processes relationships between different parts of the input, while the feed-forward components handle intermediate representations. - `lora_alpha=16`: Scaling factor for LoRA updates, controlling their impact on the model - `lora_dropout=0`: No dropout applied to LoRA layers to maximize learning `lora_alpha` controls how strongly LoRA updates affect the model’s behavior. Setting it equal to the rank provides balanced scaling of the modifications during training. lora\\_dropout=0 disables dropout regularization on LoRA layers, allowing full use of all parameters during training to maximize learning capacity from the training data. - `bias=\"none\"`: No bias parameters are trained, focusing on weight updates - `use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\"`: Enables memory-efficient training for long sequences - `use_rslora=False`: Disables rank-stabilized LoRA variant - `loftq_config=None`: No low-rank fine-tuning with quantization configuration This configuration optimizes for efficient training while maintaining model quality, reducing memory usage and training time compared to full fine-tuning. Next, we configure the training arguments that control the training process. These settings determine important aspects like batch size, learning rate, and optimization parameters. ```python from transformers import TrainingArguments from unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported model_name = \"firecrawl-assistant\" local_path = f\"./models/{model_name}\" training_arguments = TrainingArguments( per_device_train_batch_size=2, gradient_accumulation_steps=4, warmup_steps=5, max_steps=100, learning_rate=2e-4, fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(), bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(), logging_steps=10, optim=\"adamw_8bit\", weight_decay=0.01, lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\", seed=1000, output_dir=local_path, push_to_hub=True, hub_model_id=f\"bexgboost/{model_name}\", report_to=\"wandb\", ) ``` The training arguments configure key training parameters: - A batch size of 2 samples per device is used, with gradient accumulation over 4 steps to simulate larger batches - The learning rate starts at 2e-4 and follows a linear schedule with 5 warmup steps - Training runs for 100 steps total - Mixed precision training is enabled using either FP16 or BF16 depending on hardware support - The AdamW 8-bit optimizer is used with 0.01 weight decay for regularization - Progress is logged every 10 steps and outputs are saved to the `local_path` directory - The model is pushed to HuggingFace hub after training - The training process is tracked with W & B Note that for this demonstration, we are training for a fixed number of steps rather than full epochs to save time. In production, you should use `num_train_epochs` to train for complete passes through the dataset, along with `warmup_ratio` instead of `warmup_steps` and `max_steps` to scale the warmup period proportionally. This ensures proper model convergence and generalization on your full dataset. Next, we set up the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer that will handle the training process. ```python from trl import SFTTrainer trainer = SFTTrainer( model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, train_dataset=dataset, dataset_text_field=\"text\", max_seq_length=2048, dataset_num_proc=2, args=training_arguments, ) ``` The SFTTrainer brings together all the components needed for training: - It takes our configured model and tokenizer - The training dataset is provided, with “text” specified as the field containing the training examples - The maximum sequence length limits input size - 2 processes are used for dataset preprocessing - The training arguments we configured earlier control the training process ### 5\\. Model training and testing Now, all we have to do is call the `train` method of the trainer: ```python trainer.train() ``` The training process may take up to an hour to finish. Once it is done, you can see the training loss on W & B dashboard. Note that since we used very few training steps (instead of full epochs), our model performance won’t be optimal and may hallucinate. With that said, let’s test it quickly on the first prompt we tried, which the model hallucinated badly: ```python FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) inputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\") text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) _ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_streamer, max_new_tokens=512, use_cache=True) ``` Here is the answer generated by our fine-tuned model: ````plaintext You can extract the repo name, number of stars, and repo link from the GitHub trending page by using Firecrawl's `scrape_url` method with the appropriate selectors. Here’s an example: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key') # Scrape GitHub's trending page for repo details response = app.scrape_url('https://github.com/trending', { 'formats': ['html'], 'selectors': { 'repo_name': '.repo-name', 'stars': '.stars', 'repo_link': '.repo-link' } }) # Print the extracted data print(\"Repo Name:\", response['repo_name']) print(\"Stars:\", response['stars']) print(\"Repo Link:\", response['repo_link']) ```` This response is actually better than I expected given how we only trained for 100 steps. The model now correctly recognizes Firecrawl as a scraping engine and it correctly determined the right scraping method - `scrape_url`. However, after the part about `formats`, it hallucinated and generated incorrect code. But this is promising since the training loss has been rapidly decreasing, suggesting that there is much room for improvement: Just a note that here is the correct code for scraping the GitHub trending pages: ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key') # Scrape GitHub trending page response = app.scrape_url('https://github.com/trending', { 'formats': ['extract'], 'extract': { 'prompt': \"\"\"Extract all trending repositories with their: - Repository name (in owner/repo format) - Number of stars - Repository URL Return as a list of objects.\"\"\" } }) # The extracted data will be in response['extract'] trending_repos = response['extract'] ``` As you can see, you only have to provide a natural language prompt to scrape the necessary fields from a webpage using Firecrawl. For more information, check out our [complete scraping guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint). ### 6\\. Saving and uploading the model Finally, we can save the model locally and upload it to HuggingFace with a couple lines of code: ```python trainer.save_model(local_path) trainer.push_to_hub() # Close W&B run wandb.finish() ``` ## Building a Chat UI For the Fine-tuned Model ## Conclusion In this guide, we’ve walked through the complete process of fine-tuning a language model for a specific domain using modern tools and techniques. We used Firecrawl’s documentation dataset to demonstrate how to efficiently train a model that can accurately answer questions about API functionality, endpoints, and best practices. The combination of Unsloth’s optimizations, HuggingFace’s ecosystem, and Weights & Biases tracking made it possible to fine-tune a large language model on consumer hardware while monitoring the training process. The resulting chatbot application showcases how fine-tuned models can be deployed locally to solve real-world problems. By loading the model directly from HuggingFace Hub and creating a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, we’ve demonstrated that running custom language models doesn’t have to be complex. This same approach can be adapted for any domain-specific application where you need an AI assistant trained on your own documentation or knowledge base.

Instruction datasets are collections of input-output pairs used to teach AI models how to respond to specific types of requests. Think of them like flashcards used in learning a new language - one side has a question or task (the instruction), and the other side has the correct response (the desired output). For example, an instruction might be “Explain what photosynthesis is to a 10-year-old,” and the paired output would be a simple, child-friendly explanation. ```json [\\ {\\ \"instruction\": \"Explain what photosynthesis is to a 10-year-old\",\\ \"answer\": \"...\",\\ },\\ // ... the rest of the dataset\\ ] ``` These datasets are crucial for a technique called supervised fine-tuning, which helps LLMs become better at specific tasks. Just like how a general medical doctor might get additional training to become a specialist, a general-purpose AI model can be fine-tuned using instruction datasets to become more skilled at particular tasks like writing code, answering medical questions, or providing customer service responses. In this article, you’ll learn when and why you might need to create your own instruction dataset, the step-by-step process of building one, and see a real-world example of creating a dataset for code documentation. By the end, you’ll have the knowledge to create instruction datasets that can help fine-tune AI models for your specific needs. ## Table of Contents - [What Are Instruction Datasets?](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#what-are-instruction-datasets) - [When to Create a Custom Instruction Dataset?](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#when-to-create-a-custom-instruction-dataset) - [Domain specificity](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#1-domain-specificity) - [Data privacy & security](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#2-data-privacy--security) - [Performance optimization](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#3-performance-optimization) - [Language & cultural adaptation](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#4-language--cultural-adaptation) - [Quality control](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#5-quality-control) - [Scale requirements](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#6-scale-requirements) - [What Formats Do Instruction Datasets Use?](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#what-formats-do-instruction-datasets-use) - [Real-world Scenario: a Custom Instruction Dataset For Code Documentation](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#real-world-scenario-a-custom-instruction-dataset-for-code-documentation) - [Project overview](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#project-overview) - [Curating a raw dataset from sources](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#curating-a-raw-dataset-from-sources) - [Cleaning the documents](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#cleaning-the-documents) - [Generating instruction-answer pairs](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#generating-instruction-answer-pairs) - [Uploading generated pairs to HuggingFace Datasets](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#uploading-generated-pairs-to-huggingface-datasets) - [General Process For Creating Instruction Datasets](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#general-process-for-creating-instruction-datasets) - [Conclusion](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#conclusion) - [Key Learnings](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#key-learnings) - [Practical Considerations](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#practical-considerations) - [Next Steps](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#next-steps) - [Additional Resources](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#additional-resources) - [Future Improvements](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning#future-improvements) ## When to Create a Custom Instruction Dataset? Creating a custom instruction dataset is a significant undertaking that requires careful consideration. While there are many high-quality public datasets available, several compelling reasons might lead you to develop your own. Let’s explore the key scenarios where building a custom instruction dataset becomes necessary or advantageous. **1\\. Domain specificity** Specialized fields like medical diagnostics, legal analysis, and technical documentation often require custom instruction datasets that go beyond general-purpose training data. While models like [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude) and [GPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4) are trained on broad knowledge, they lack the depth needed for domain-specific tasks that require expert-level understanding and specialized vocabulary. Public datasets from [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and others primarily focus on common use cases and general knowledge, making them insufficient for specialized applications. **2\\. Data privacy & security** Organizations dealing with sensitive information face strict regulatory requirements and confidentiality concerns that necessitate creating private instruction datasets. Healthcare providers must ensure [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) compliance while working with patient data, while financial institutions need to protect proprietary trading strategies and client information. Companies like [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) and [UnitedHealth Group](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/) have pioneered approaches to create secure instruction datasets that maintain data privacy while implementing strict access controls. **3\\. Performance optimization** Task-specific performance requirements often drive the need for custom instruction datasets optimized for particular use cases. [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) demonstrated this by creating specialized datasets for data science and SQL tasks, achieving significantly better results than models trained on general-purpose data. The success of models like [CodeLlama](https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/) shows how carefully curated instruction datasets can dramatically improve performance in specific domains. **4\\. Language & cultural adaptation** The English-centric nature of many public datasets creates barriers for organizations serving diverse global audiences. Companies operating in different regions need instruction data that reflects local languages, dialects, cultural references, and communication styles. Major technology companies like [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) have invested in creating region-specific instruction datasets that capture the nuances of their target markets. **5\\. Quality control:** The varying quality of public datasets, which often contain errors, inconsistencies, and outdated information, drives many organizations to create curated instruction sets. Popular resources like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), while valuable, can propagate incorrect solutions and obsolete practices if used directly for training. Leading technology organizations like [GitHub](https://github.com/) have addressed this by developing rigorous quality control processes for their instruction datasets. **6\\. Scale requirements** While smaller public datasets like [Stanford’s Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) provide good starting points, many applications require instruction datasets of much greater scale and diversity. The limited size of available datasets can constrain model performance and generalization ability. Industry leaders like [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) have demonstrated the importance of scale, using millions of carefully crafted instructions in their training processes. These examples show why many companies are putting more resources into creating their own instruction datasets. They see it as an essential tool for building AI systems that work well for their particular goals and requirements. ## What Formats Do Instruction Datasets Use? Instruction datasets typically follow standardized formats to ensure compatibility with training pipelines and model architectures. The most common format is JSON, where each example is a dictionary containing fields like “instruction” and “response”. This format was popularized by [Stanford’s Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) dataset and has been adopted by many others. Some datasets include additional fields like “context” or “category” to provide more structure. ```json { \"instruction\": \"Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number\", \"context\": \"Python programming, basic algorithms\", \"response\": \"def factorial(n):\\n if n == 0:\\n return 1\\n return n * factorial(n-1)\", \"category\": \"programming\" } ``` [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) (JSON Lines) format is preferred for large-scale datasets due to its streaming-friendly nature. Each line contains a complete instruction-response pair, making it efficient for processing massive datasets. This format is used by [OpenAI’s](https://openai.com/) GPT training data and [Anthropic’s](https://anthropic.com/) Constitutional AI datasets. [HuggingFace’s](https://huggingface.co/) Datasets library provides native support for JSONL, making it a popular choice for dataset distribution. Some datasets use more structured formats for specific applications. For example, [Microsoft’s](https://microsoft.com/) CodeParrot dataset uses a YAML-based format that preserves code indentation and includes metadata like programming language and documentation standards. Similarly, [Google’s](https://google.com/) FLAN collection uses a custom protobuf format that efficiently handles multiple languages and includes provenance information for each example. Quality control metadata is often incorporated into the format. The [Dolly](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) dataset includes fields for validation status, source attribution, and version tracking. [Anthropic’s](https://anthropic.com/) dataset format includes fields for safety classifications and bias assessments. These additional fields help in filtering and selecting examples during training: ```json { \"instruction\": \"Explain how to invest in stocks\", \"response\": \"...\", \"metadata\": { \"safety_rating\": \"approved\", \"bias_check\": \"passed\", \"source\": \"financial_experts\", \"validation_status\": \"peer_reviewed\", \"last_updated\": \"2024-01-15\" } } ``` For multilingual datasets, formats must handle different character encodings and writing systems. Meta’s NLLB dataset uses Unicode normalization and includes language codes and script information for each example. The format also preserves bidirectional text formatting for languages like Arabic and Hebrew: ```json { \"instruction\": { \"text\": \"Translate this sentence to French\", \"lang\": \"en\", \"script\": \"Latn\" }, \"response\": { \"text\": \"Traduisez cette phrase en français\", \"lang\": \"fr\", \"script\": \"Latn\" } } ``` Version control and dataset evolution are managed through format extensions. Many organizations use dataset formats that track changes over time, similar to git for code. This includes fields for version numbers, change history, and deprecation notices, helping maintain dataset quality as requirements evolve. Standardized dataset formats with rich metadata and version control capabilities are essential for building high-quality instruction datasets that can evolve over time. ## Real-world Scenario: a Custom Instruction Dataset For Code Documentation Let’s explore a practical example of creating a custom instruction dataset for code documentation. This is particularly relevant given how the explosion of LLMs has led to rapid development of new open-source tools and frameworks. Interestingly, even advanced language models like Claude or OpenAI o3 struggle to provide accurate information about these tools, since their training data predates much of the current documentation. Consider [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/), an API scraping engine that converts webpages into LLM-ready data. When asked about Firecrawl, today’s LLMs often provide inaccurate or fabricated information. To address this gap, we’ll create a custom instruction dataset to fine-tune a language model for generating technically accurate code examples for Firecrawl and answering questions about it. ## Project overview This project was implemented in four scripts: 1. [`scrape_raw_data.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/scrape_raw_data.py): Uses Firecrawl to scrape documentation and blog posts from firecrawl.dev, creating a raw dataset of markdown files. - Scrapes both `docs.firecrawl.dev` and `firecrawl.dev/blog` - Extracts page content, titles, and URLs - Saves files with frontmatter metadata - Handles rate limiting and retries 2. [`process_dataset.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/process_dataset.py): Processes the raw markdown files into clean, chunked training data. - Cleans markdown formatting while preserving code blocks - Splits content into meaningful chunks using header-based splitting - Filters chunks based on relevance and information density - Adds metadata and unique IDs to each chunk - Outputs a structured JSON dataset 3. [`generate.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/generate.py): Creates instruction-answer pairs using `gpt-4o-mini`. - Uses a carefully engineered system prompt to generate diverse examples - Handles rate limiting and parallel processing - Preserves code blocks and formatting in responses - Generates multiple instruction types: - Code examples - Configuration explanations - Best practices - Common use cases - Troubleshooting scenarios 4. [`upload_to_hf.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/upload_to_hf.py): Prepares and uploads the dataset to HuggingFace Hub. - Converts JSON to HuggingFace Dataset format - Splits data into training and validation sets - Handles authentication and repository creation - Uploads with proper versioning and metadata The end result is a decent instruction dataset specifically focused on Firecrawl’s features and capabilities, ready for fine-tuning language models. If you want to explore the code straight away, we’ve pushed [all scripts and additional files](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset) to our examples repository. You will also find the setup instructions and a list of environment variables you have to configure to run the project locally. If you want a breakdown of what is happening inside each script, continue reading! ### Curating a raw dataset from sources The first step in creating a fine-tuned model is gathering high-quality training data. The approach to data collection varies significantly depending on whether you’re building a task-specific or domain-specific model. For task-specific models (like code generation or text summarization): - Data typically comes from existing public datasets or carefully created examples - Quality matters more than quantity - a few thousand well-crafted examples often outperform millions of noisy ones - Dataset size usually ranges from 1,000 to 50,000 examples, depending on task complexity - Examples: GitHub code pairs for code generation, news article summaries for summarization For domain-specific models (like medical or legal assistants): - Data collection requires collaboration with subject matter experts - Sources include technical documentation, research papers, and expert-validated content - Dataset size typically needs to be larger, often 50,000 to 500,000 examples - Quality control through expert review is essential - Examples: Medical papers for healthcare models, legal documents for legal assistants In our Firecrawl fine-tuning example, we’re creating a domain-specific dataset focused on API documentation. We chose to scrape from: - Official documentation ( [docs.firecrawl.dev](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/)) - Technical blog posts ( [firecrawl.dev/blog](https://firecrawl.dev/blog)) These sources were selected because they: 1. Contain accurate, up-to-date information about the API 2. Include real-world usage examples and best practices 3. Cover common issues and their solutions 4. Represent different writing styles and technical depths 5. Are publicly accessible and maintained by the core team The goal is to create a dataset that enables our fine-tuned model to accurately answer questions about Firecrawl’s API, provide relevant code examples, and troubleshoot common issues. At this point, we refer to [`src/scrape_raw_data.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/scrape_raw_data.py) script which handles scraping these two sources. The script uses Firecrawl itself to scrape Firecrawl blog and documentation. Let’s break it down. First, let’s look at the imports and configuration: ```python import logging import os from pathlib import Path from typing import List from dotenv import load_dotenv from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from pydantic import BaseModel, Field logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) BLOG_URL = \"https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog\" DOCS_URL = \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\" ``` This setup establishes logging (crucial for monitoring long-running scraping jobs) and defines our target URLs. When adapting this for your own use: - Replace the URLs with your documentation sources - Consider adding more logging handlers (e.g., file output) - Use environment variables for sensitive URLs - Add as many URLs as you need to scrape Next, we define our data model: ```python class Page(BaseModel): title: str = Field(description=\"Page title\") content: str = Field(description=\"Main content of the page\") url: str = Field(description=\"Page URL\") ``` Using Pydantic ensures our scraped data is properly structured and validated. The core scraping logic is encapsulated in the `Scraper` class: ```python class Scraper: def __init__(self, base_url: str = None): self.app = FirecrawlApp() self.base_url = base_url def get_sublinks(self, base_url: str) -> list[str]: \"\"\"Get all sublinks from a given base URL.\"\"\" initial_crawl = self.app.crawl_url( base_url, params={ \"scrapeOptions\": {\"formats\": [\"links\"]}, }, ) all_links = [] for item in initial_crawl[\"data\"]: all_links.extend(item[\"links\"]) filtered_links = set( [link.split(\"#\")[0] for link in all_links if link.startswith(base_url)] ) return list(filtered_links) ``` The `get_sublinks` method handles link discovery using Firecrawl’s `crawl_url` method. As you can tell from the name, this method crawls every single subpage of a given URL and returns all sub-links. For example, if the base URL is `docs.firecrawl.dev`, a found sub-link may look like `docs.firecrawl.dev/quickstart`. Once the crawling finishes, the method collects all links into a list. The links are filtered to remove duplicates using a set and to only include links that start with the base URL. Fragment identifiers (the part after #) are also stripped from the URLs to avoid duplicating pages that only differ by their anchor. The filtered list of unique URLs is then returned for further processing. Key points for adaptation: - Adjust link filtering based on your site’s structure - Add exclusion patterns for irrelevant sections - Consider implementing depth limits for large sites - [Read our separate guide on crawling websites with Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-the-crawl-endpoint-in-firecrawl) Next, we have the `scrape_sublinks` method: ```python def scrape_sublinks(self, base_url: str, limit: int = None) -> List[Page]: \"\"\"Scrape content from discovered links.\"\"\" filtered_links = self.get_sublinks(base_url) if limit: filtered_links = filtered_links[:limit] crawl_results = self.app.batch_scrape_urls(filtered_links) pages = [] for result in crawl_results[\"data\"]: if result.get(\"markdown\"): pages.append( Page( title=result.get(\"metadata\", {}).get(\"title\", \"Untitled\"), content=result[\"markdown\"], url=result.get(\"metadata\", {}).get(\"url\", \"\"), ) ) return pages ``` This method scrapes the pages returned by `get_sublinks`. It first gets the filtered list of links and optionally limits the number of pages to scrape. Then it uses Firecrawl’s batch scraping capability (via `batch_scrape_urls`) to efficiently fetch the content of all discovered pages in parallel. For each successfully scraped page, it extracts the title, content (in markdown format), and URL from the API response and creates a `Page` object to store this data. The method returns a list of all successfully scraped pages. Pages that don’t contain markdown content are skipped to ensure we only process relevant content. Next, we have data storage: ```python def save_pages(self, pages: List[Page], docs_dir: str): \"\"\"Save scraped content as markdown files.\"\"\" Path(docs_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) for page in pages: url_path = page.url.replace(self.base_url, \"\") safe_filename = url_path.strip(\"/\").replace(\"/\", \"-\") filepath = os.path.join(docs_dir, f\"{safe_filename}.md\") with open(filepath, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f: f.write(\"---\\n\") f.write(f\"title: {page.title}\\n\") f.write(f\"url: {page.url}\\n\") f.write(\"---\\n\\n\") f.write(page.content) ``` The `save_pages` method handles storing the scraped content to disk as markdown files. It takes a list of `Page` objects and a target directory path as input. For each page, it: 1. Creates the output directory if it doesn’t exist 2. Extracts a clean filename from the page URL by removing the base URL and replacing slashes 3. Constructs the full output filepath 4. Writes the content with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like title and URL 5. Saves the markdown content of the page This approach preserves the original content structure while adding useful metadata in a standard format. The markdown files can then be easily processed further or used directly. When adapting the storage logic: - Choose an appropriate file format (markdown, JSON, etc.) - Implement proper error handling for file operations - Consider compression for large datasets - Add metadata that’s relevant to your use case Finally, we have a parent method to tie everything together: ```python def pull(self, base_url: str, docs_dir: str, n_pages: int = None): self.base_url = base_url pages = self.scrape_sublinks(base_url, n_pages) self.save_pages(pages, docs_dir) ``` Now, we can pull all the pages of both the blog and the documentation: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": load_dotenv() scraper = Scraper(base_url=BLOG_URL) scraper.pull(BLOG_URL, \"data/raw/firecrawl/blog\") scraper = Scraper(base_url=DOCS_URL) scraper.pull(DOCS_URL, \"data/raw/firecrawl/docs\") ``` > Note the use of `load_dotenv()` to read environment variables from a `.env` file. Key considerations for your own implementation: 1. Data quality: Ensure your scraping captures all necessary content 2. Error handling: Implement robust error handling and logging 3. Rate limiting: Respect website limits and implement appropriate delays 4. Storage: Choose appropriate storage formats and organization 5. Validation: Add checks to ensure scraped data meets your requirements 6. Documentation: Document any site-specific handling or assumptions An important point to mention here is how the Firecrawl documentation and blog is structured. The documentation is organized into clear sections with a hierarchical structure - main concepts, guides, API reference, etc. Each page follows a consistent format with a title, description, and content sections. The blog posts are more narrative in style but still maintain good structure with headers, code examples, and explanations. This consistent organization makes it easier to scrape and process the content while preserving the logical flow and relationships between different pieces of information. Custom data sources often have different structures, making it impractical to use a single scraper for all of them. While implementing multiple scrapers takes some work, Firecrawl significantly reduces the overall effort by eliminating the need for traditional HTML/CSS scraping techniques. You can either convert entire webpages to markdown format (like you’ve already seen) or [extract specific content by describing what you need in natural language](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-extract-endpoint). ### Cleaning the documents Now, we come to the dreaded part - cleaning the scraped documents. Whatever your task is, data cleaning is always going to be the most critical and time-consuming part of your project. Instruction dataset generation is no exception. First of all, our curated dataset must be representative of how the fine-tuned model will be used. Once we have gathered enough raw data, our goal is to filter them to only keep high-quality data. In this context, high-quality data can be described through three main dimensions: 1. Accuracy: The data must be factually correct and relevant to the domain. This means ensuring that technical details, code examples, and explanations are accurate and up-to-date. For documentation data, accuracy also means maintaining consistency with the actual API behavior and implementation details. The samples should avoid any misleading or incorrect information that could negatively impact the model’s learning. 2. Diversity: The dataset needs to cover the full spectrum of use cases that represent real-world usage. This includes different types of queries (how-to guides, troubleshooting, conceptual explanations), varying levels of technical depth, and different aspects of the API or product. A diverse dataset helps prevent the model from becoming overly specialized in one area while being weak in others. 3. Complexity: The dataset should incorporate samples that require sophisticated reasoning and multi-step problem solving. This could include debugging scenarios, architectural decisions, performance optimization recommendations, and security considerations. Complex examples help the model develop deeper understanding and better reasoning capabilities, rather than just memorizing simple patterns. Our aim is to transform the raw markdown files into the following instruction-answer format that also meet the above criteria at the same time: ````python { \"instruction\": \"How do I specify which paths to include or exclude during a crawl?\", \"answer\": \"You can use the `includePaths` and `excludePaths` parameters in your request to specify which paths to include or exclude. Here's an example in Python:\\n```...```\\n\\n In this example, the crawler will include only the `/public` path and exclude the `/private` path from the crawl.\" } ```` That is exactly what the [`src/process_dataset.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/process_dataset.py) file does. Since it is over 300 lines long, we won’t focus on the implementation details but provide a high-level overview of the functions used to transform the raw files: ```python def load_config() -> Config: \"\"\"Load configuration from environment or defaults\"\"\" ... ``` This function creates a configuration object with settings for the dataset processing. It reads from environment variables or uses default values for: - Input directory containing markdown files - Output file path for the processed dataset - Keywords to filter relevant content - Processing parameters like chunk size and model settings ```python def clean_markdown(content: str) -> str: \"\"\"Clean markdown content while preserving important information.\"\"\" ... ``` Takes raw markdown text and cleans it by: - Removing empty markdown links - Fixing escaped characters - Normalizing whitespace and newlines - Preserving important formatting ```python def process_directory(input_dir: Path, output_dir: Path): \"\"\"Process all markdown files in a directory.\"\"\" ... ``` Processes an entire directory of markdown files by: - Finding all `.md` files recursively - Cleaning each file’s content - Saving cleaned files to output directory with same structure These three functions combined are responsible for cleaning the raw markdown files and saving them back to a new directory for further processing. The next set of functions handles filtering file contents to extract relevant text. This filtering step is important for two reasons. Documentation pages already contain focused information about Firecrawl, but blog articles often discuss other topics not directly related to Firecrawl. We need to identify and keep only the paragraphs that specifically discuss Firecrawl functionality, which we accomplish through keyword-based filtering. Let’s look at the first filtering function in `process_dataset.py` \\- a simple boolean check that determines if a text contains any specified keywords: ```python def contains_keywords(text: str, keywords: List[str]) -> bool: \"\"\"Check if text contains any keywords (case-insensitive).\"\"\" ... ``` We will use `contains_keywords` on chunks of markdown files generated by the function below: ```python def chunk_markdown(content: str, ...) -> List[str]: \"\"\"Split markdown into chunks based on headers.\"\"\" ... return chunks ``` `chunk_markdown` splits a markdown file based on H2, H3 or H4 headings and only keep the chunks that contain certain keywords related to Firecrawl using the `contains_keywords` method above. Then, we create another function to standardize these chunks into a list of dictionaries format: ```python def process_chunks_in_batches(chunks: List[str], ...) -> List[Dict]: \"\"\"Process chunks in batches.\"\"\" ... return informative_chunks ``` In this function, each chunk is represented by a dictionary with the chunk’s contents, metadata and a unique ID generated using the `uuid` library. Finally, we create a parent function to orchestrate everything: ```python async def create_dataset(config: Config): \"\"\"Create the final dataset.\"\"\" ... # Save dataset save_json(config.output_file, {\"data\": dataset}) ``` The function retrieves all cleaned markdown files, chunks them based on headers, filters the chunks using Firecrawl-related keywords, standardizes them into a uniform format and saves them to a JSON file. Here is what this JSON file looks like containing over 1300 chunks: Each chunk contains important information about Firecrawl and how to use its SDKs. As you can see, each chunk dictionary has the following attributes: - ID - Source file path - Content - Metadata Here is how you can adapt this script for your own project: 1. For different content types: - Modify `clean_markdown()` to handle your specific formatting - Add custom cleaning rules in `process_directory()` 2. For different chunking strategies: - Adjust header levels in `chunk_markdown()` - Implement custom splitting logic - Modify chunk filtering criteria 3. For different filtering needs: - Update `blog_keywords` in `config` (see the full script itself to see the keywords) - Add custom filtering functions 4. For different output formats: - Modify the output structure in `process_chunks_in_batches()` - Update the save format in `create_dataset()` - Add custom serialization methods 5. For performance optimization: - Adjust batch sizes in config - Implement caching if needed - Add parallel processing for large datasets Remember to: - Test changes with small datasets first - Monitor memory usage with large files - Add error handling for your specific cases - Document any custom logic you add ### Generating instruction-answer pairs At this stage, we have cleaned and chunked our raw curated data into an acceptable format. However, we still need one more step to go from chunks to instruction-answer pairs. While such data can be generated manually by individuals or through crowdsourcing, these methods often generate significant costs. A much budget-friendly alternative is using LLMs to generate synthetic data. LLMs can function at a much larger scale and cost significantly less than manual data preparation. That is exactly what we are doing inside [`src/generate.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/generate.py) of our repository. The script takes our processed chunks as anchors or contexts and generates 5 synthetic instruction-answer pairs off of each. This results in more than 6k pairs, a respectable size for a fine-tuning job. Let’s break down the script, starting with the `generate_pairs_for_chunk` method: ```python async def generate_pairs_for_chunk( chunk: Dict, chat: ChatOpenAI, ... ) -> List[Dict]: \"\"\"Generate instruction-answer pairs with rate limiting.\"\"\" # ... the rest of the method messages = [\\ SystemMessage(content=SYSTEM_PROMPT),\\ HumanMessage(\\ content=f\"Generate instruction-answer pairs from this documentation:\\n\\n{chunk['content']}\"\\ ),\\ ] response = await chat.ainvoke(messages) # ... the rest of the method return pairs ``` This method takes a chunk dictionary as input and generates five instruction-answer pairs using a chat model through LangChain. The method is also responsible for parsing the LLM’s output into 5 distinct instruction-answer pair dictionaries. Next, we have the `generate_dataset` method: ```python async def generate_dataset( input_file: Path, output_file: Path, chunk_limit: int = None ): \"\"\"Generate dataset with parallel processing and rate limiting.\"\"\" ... ``` This function processes all chunks we have, generates 5 instruction-answer pairs using `generate_pairs_for_chunk` and combines them all to a single JSON dataset file” ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": input_file = Path(\"data/firecrawl_chunked_dataset.json\") output_file = Path(\"data/firecrawl_instructions.json\") asyncio.run(generate_dataset(input_file, output_file)) ``` There are many important points to keep in mind when orchestrating this synthetic data generation process. First and most important is the system prompt used to guide the model’s generation. The system prompt must be well-crafted to guide the language model to produce diverse, relevant, and high-quality instruction-response pairs. The system prompt we’ve used includes specific instructions, several example pairs and constraints to ensure the generated data aligns with the desired format and content. Even though our system prompt is over 100 lines, many production synthetic-data generation pipelines include multiple layers to ensure data quality. This may include generating an initial set of pairs, then another system for implementing validation steps where another model checks the generated pairs for accuracy, relevance and adherence to the system prompt instructions (LLM-as-a-judge). Another key factor is the model itself. Our script used `gpt-4o-mini` for its low costs and fast token generation (it costs about $1 to generate the entire dataset) but in a real-world setting, you should preferably choose `gpt-4o` or `claude-3-5-sonnet` as they offer much higher performance. But they often cost up to 20 times higher than smaller models, so you need to think about balancing cost and accuracy depending on your fine-tuning task. Keep in mind that implementing additional data quality layers incur yet higher costs. Finally, you must consider the time and rate limiting of the chosen model. Most LLM APIs have strict rate limits. Our script implements rate limiting using semaphores and token counting to stay within these limits while maximizing throughput. We also use concurrent processing with `asyncio` to parallelize requests efficiently. Without proper rate limiting, your requests will be throttled or rejected, significantly slowing down or breaking the data generation process. ### Uploading generated pairs to HuggingFace Datasets At this stage, you can call it a day since you already have the dataset. But to provide easy access to it to your colleagues or to third parties (if it is a public dataset), you must upload it to HuggingFace Hub. Once uploaded, anyone can use your dataset through the `datasets` library for fine-tuning tasks. This is what is happening inside the [`src/upload_to_hf.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/blob/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset/src/upload_to_hf.py) file. The `prepare_dataset` function transforms the instruction-answer pairs to HuggingFace-compatible format, splits it into training and validation sets and returns them as a `DatasetDict` object. This object is then sent to HuggingFace inside the `push_to_hub` method. A few minutes after uploading, you will be able to explore the dataset on the platform visually: To use the dataset, all you have to do is run these couple lines of code in your environment: ```python from datasets import load_dataset ds = load_dataset(\"bexgboost/firecrawl-instructions\") ``` ## General Process For Creating Instruction Datasets Let’s summarize the key steps we took to create our instruction dataset, which you can follow for your own tasks: 1. Prepare your source data - Gather documentation, articles, or other text content - Clean and preprocess the text as needed - Split into manageable chunks if working with large documents 2. Design your system prompt - Write clear instructions for the LLM - Include example instruction-response pairs - Define constraints and quality requirements - Test and refine the prompt with sample generations The majority of your time must be spent implementing steps 1 and 2. 3. Set up the generation pipeline - Choose an appropriate LLM (consider cost vs quality tradeoffs) - Implement rate limiting and concurrency controls - Add error handling and logging - Consider adding validation steps (LLM-as-judge) 4. Generate the dataset - Run the generation script - Monitor the process for errors - Sample and manually review outputs - Adjust parameters if needed 5. Process and format the data - Convert to the desired format (JSON, CSV etc.) - Split into train/validation sets - Add metadata if needed - Validate the final structure 6. Share and distribute - Upload to a platform like HuggingFace - Document the dataset creation process - Provide usage examples - Set appropriate access permissions Following these steps will help ensure you create a high-quality instruction dataset suitable for fine-tuning language models. ## Conclusion Creating high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for fine-tuning language models that can perform specialized tasks effectively. Through this guide, we’ve demonstrated how to build such datasets systematically, using Firecrawl’s documentation as a practical example. Let’s recap the key takeaways: ### Key Learnings - **Data Quality Matters**: The success of your fine-tuned model heavily depends on the quality of your instruction dataset. Invest time in proper data cleaning and validation. - **Automation is Essential**: Using tools like Firecrawl and LLMs for data generation can significantly reduce the time and cost of dataset creation, while maintaining quality. - **Balance is Critical**: When generating synthetic data, balance between quantity, quality, and cost is crucial. While larger models like GPT-4 provide better quality, smaller models can be cost-effective for initial iterations. - **Process Matters**: Following a structured process - from data collection through cleaning to generation - helps ensure consistent quality and reproducible results. ### Practical Considerations - A dataset of 5,000-10,000 high-quality instruction-answer pairs is often sufficient for specialized fine-tuning - Budget approximately $1-20 for synthetic data generation, depending on the chosen LLM - Plan for 2-3 iterations of data cleaning and validation to achieve optimal quality - Consider implementing automated quality checks to maintain consistency ### Next Steps If you’re ready to create your own instruction dataset: 1. **Start Small**: Begin with a pilot dataset of 100-200 pairs to test your pipeline 2. **Validate Early**: Implement quality checks from the beginning 3. **Iterate Quickly**: Get feedback and refine your process before scaling up 4. **Monitor Quality**: Regularly review generated pairs and adjust your system prompt as needed ### Additional Resources - [Firecrawl Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/) \\- For detailed API reference - [Stanford Alpaca Paper](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) \\- For insights on instruction tuning - [HuggingFace’s Guide to Dataset Creation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/create_dataset) - [Our Example Repository](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/custom-fine-tuning-dataset) ### Future Improvements The field of instruction tuning is rapidly evolving. Some promising areas for future exploration include: - **Multi-modal Instructions**: Incorporating images and code snippets into instruction datasets - **Automated Validation**: Using LLMs to validate and improve generated pairs - **Cross-lingual Datasets**: Creating instruction sets that work across multiple languages - **Dynamic Updates**: Building systems for continuous dataset improvement based on model performance By following the approaches outlined in this guide and staying current with these developments, you’ll be well-equipped to create effective instruction datasets for your specific use cases. Whether you’re building a specialized coding assistant, a domain-specific chatbot, or any other AI application, the quality of your instruction dataset will be a key determinant of your model’s success.

No scrapers. No pipelines. Just results. ## Getting web data is hard If you’ve ever needed structured data from websites—whether to enrich your CRM, monitor competitors, or power various applications—you’re probably familiar with the frustrating options available today: - Manually researching and copy-pasting data from multiple sources, consuming countless hours - Writing and maintaining fragile web scrapers that break at the slightest site change - Using scraping services and building complex LLM pipelines with limited context windows that force you to break down data manually Fortunately, with our /extract endpoint, you can leave these cumbersome approaches in the past and focus on what matters - getting the data you need. ## What You Can Build With /extract Companies are already using /extract to: - Enrich thousands of CRM leads with company data - Automate KYB processes with structured business information - Track competitor prices and feature changes in real-time - Build targeted prospecting lists at scale Here’s how it works: 1. Write a prompt describing the data you need 2. Point us at any website (use wildcards like example.com/\\*) 3. Get back clean, structured JSON No more broken scrapers. No more complex pipelines. Just the data you need to build. ## Current Limitations While /extract handles most web data needs effectively, there are some edge cases we’re actively improving: 1. Scale Limitations: Very large sites (think Amazon’s entire catalog) require breaking requests into smaller chunks 2. Advanced Filtering: Complex queries like time-based filtering are still in development 3. Consistency: Multiple runs may return slightly different results as we refine our extraction model We’re actively working on these areas. Our goal is to make web data as accessible as an API - and we’re getting closer every day. ## Get Started 1. **Try it Now** - Get 500,000 free tokens in our [playground](https://www.firecrawl.dev/playground?mode=extract) - See examples and experiment with different prompts - No credit card required 2. **Build Something Real** - Read the [technical docs](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/extract) - Connect with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/firecrawl/integrations) for no-code workflows Ready to turn web data into your competitive advantage?

{"instruction": "Write a detailed technical blog post from the perspective of a software engineer at Firecrawl, covering their experience scaling a web scraping service from 100 requests per second to over 3000, including lessons learned, challenges overcome, and tools used, with a focus on reliability, performance, and customer support.", "response": "[Launch Week III RecapSee our releasesApril 14th to 20th](https://www.firecrawl.dev/launch-week) Sep 13, 2024 • [Gergő Móricz (mogery)](https://x.com/mo_geryy) # Handling 300k requests per day: an adventure in scaling When I joined the Firecrawl team in early July, we spent most of our time working on new features and minor bugfixes. Life was good — we could focus mostly on shipping shiny new stuff without worrying as much about architecture and server load. However, as we grew over time, we started experiencing the “hug of death” a lot more. People loved our product so much that our architecture couldn’t take it anymore, and every day there was a brand new fire to put out. We knew that this was unsustainable, and ultimately it damages our DX more than any new feature we could put out could make up for. We knew we had to change things, stat. ## Our architecture, before the storm We host our API service on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), which allows us to easily deploy our code in a Docker container. It also manages load balancing, log collection, zero-downtime deployment strategies, VPC management, and a whole load of other stuff for us, which is very useful. Our main API service has two kinds of “processes”, as Fly calls it: `app` and `worker`. `app` processes use Express to serve the main API, perform scrape requests (which take a relatively short time), and delegate crawls to `worker` processes using the [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) job queue. `worker` processes register themselves as workers on the job queue, and perform crawls (which take a relatively long time). Both processes use Supabase to handle authentication and store data in Postgres. Bull also runs on top of Redis, which we deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/), since it’s super easy to use. ## Locks are hard As more and more people started using us, more and more people started finding bugs. We started getting odd issues with crawls sometimes being stuck for hours without any progress. I charted the timing of these crawls, and I saw that it was happening every time we redeployed. Due to some miscellaneous memory leak issues, we were redeploying our entire service every 2 hours via GitHub Actions, in order to essentially restart all our machines. This killed all our workers, which had acquired locks for these crawl jobs. I was not too familiar with the codebase at this point, and I thought that these locks got hard-stuck on the dead workers, so I to add some code to release all of the current worker’s locks on termination. This ended up being really complicated, due to multiple factors: 1. Other libraries we used also had cleanup code on `SIGTERM`. When you listen to `SIGTERM`, your app doesn’t actually quit until the handler calls `process.exit()`. So, the other library’s handler called `process.exit()` when its handler finished, which caused a race condition with our cleanup handler. (This was absolute hell to debug.) 2. Fly.io sometimes didn’t respect our configuration, and hard- `SIGKILL` ed our application before the 30 second timeout we specified our config. This cut our cleanup code short. 3. There was no easy way to remove a lock via the Bull API. The only legitimate way it could be done was to: 1. Get all in-progress jobs of this worker 2. Set their status to failed 3. Delete them from the queue 4. Re-insert them to the queue 4. While the cleanup code was running, there was no easy way to disable the current worker, so sometimes jobs the cleanup code re-inserted were immediately picked up by the same worker that was about to be shut down. 5. Due to our rollover deployment strategy, during a deployment, the re-inserted jobs were picked up by workers that have not been updated yet. This caused all the jobs to be piled up on the last worker to be updated, which caused the cleanup code to run longer than Fly’s maximum process shutdown timeout. While I was going down a rabbithole that was spiraling out of control, Thomas (another Firecrawl engineer who mainly works on [Fire-Engine](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/introducing-fire-engine-for-firecrawl), which used a similar architecture) discovered that our queue lock options were grossly misconfigured: ```typescript webScraperQueue = new Queue(\"web-scraper\", process.env.REDIS_URL, { settings: { lockDuration: 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 2 hours in milliseconds lockRenewTime: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes in milliseconds }, }); ``` This was originally written with the understanding that `lockDuration` would be the maximum amount of time a job could take — which is not true. When a worker stops renewing the lock every `lockRenewTime` milliseconds, `lockDuration` specifies the amount of time to wait before declaring the job as `stalled` and giving it to another worker. This was causing the crawls to be locked up for 2 hours, similar to what our customers were reporting. After I got rid of all my super-complex cleanup code, the fix ended up being this: ```typescript webScraperQueue = new Queue(\"web-scraper\", process.env.REDIS_URL, { settings: { lockDuration: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute in milliseconds lockRenewTime: 15 * 1000, // 15 seconds in milliseconds }, }); ``` Thank you Thomas for spotting that one and keeping me from going off the deep end! ## Scaling scrape requests, the easy way As you might have noticed in the architecture description, we were running scrape requests on the `app` process, the same one that serves our API. We were just starting a scrape in the `/v0/scrape` endpoint handler, and returning the results. This is simple to build, but it isn’t sustainable. We had no idea how many scrape requests we were running and when, there was no way to retry failed scrape requests, we had no data source to scale the `app` process on (other than are we down or not), and we had to scrape Express along with it. We needed to move scraping to our `worker` process. We ended up choosing to just add scrape jobs to the same queue as crawling jobs. This way the `app` submitted the job, the `worker` completed it, and the `app` waited for it to be done and returned the data. [We read the old advice about “never wait for jobs to finish”](https://blog.taskforce.sh/do-not-wait-for-your-jobs-to-complete/), but we decided to cautiously ignore it, since it would have ruined the amazing simplicity that the scrape endpoint has. This ended up [being surprisingly simple](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/commit/6798695ee4daf1ce1b289db494d260d718b6752b#diff-6753e371514e1d188e797436080479e7c781d96183601ab8fa203e4df6ca0400), only slightly affected by Bull’s odd API. We had to add a global event handler to check if the job had completed, since it lacked the [`Job.waitUntilFinished`](https://api.docs.bullmq.io/classes/v5.Job.html#waitUntilFinished) function that its successor [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq) already had. We saw a huge drop in weird behaviour on our `app` machines, and we were able to scale them down in exchange for more `worker` machines, making us way faster. ## Smaller is better The redeploy crawl fiasco made us worried about handling big crawls. We could essentially 2x the time a big crawl ran if it was caught in the middle of a redeploy, which is sub-optimal. Some of our workers were also crashing with an OOM error when working on large crawls. We instead decided to break crawls down to individual scrape jobs that chain together and spawn new jobs when they find new URLs. We decided to make every job in the queue have a scrape type. Scrape jobs that are associated with crawls have an extra bit of metadata tying them to the crawlId. This crawlId refers to some redis keys that coordinate the crawling process. The crawl itself has some basic data including the origin URL, the team associated with the request, the robots.txt file, and others: ```typescript export type StoredCrawl = { originUrl: string; crawlerOptions: any; pageOptions: any; team_id: string; plan: string; robots?: string; cancelled?: boolean; createdAt: number; }; export async function saveCrawl(id: string, crawl: StoredCrawl) { await redisConnection.set(\"crawl:\" + id, JSON.stringify(crawl)); await redisConnection.expire(\"crawl:\" + id, 24 * 60 * 60, \"NX\"); } export async function getCrawl(id: string): Promise { const x = await redisConnection.get(\"crawl:\" + id); if (x === null) { return null; } return JSON.parse(x); } ``` We also make heavy use of Redis sets to determine which URLs have been already visited when discovering new pages. The Redis `SADD` command adds a new element to a set. Since sets can only store unique values, it returns 1 or 0 based on whether the element was added or not. (The element does not get added if it was already in the set before.) We use this as a lock mechanism, to make sure two workers don’t discover the same URL at the same time and add two jobs for them. ```typescript async function lockURL(id: string, url: string): Promise { // [...] const res = (await redisConnection.sadd(\"crawl:\" + id + \":visited\", url)) !== 0; // [...] return res; } async function onURLDiscovered(crawl: string, url: string) { if (await lockURL(crawl, url)) { // we are the first ones to discover this URL await addScrapeJob(/* ... */); // add new job for this URL } } ``` You can take a look at the whole Redis logic around orchestrating crawls [here](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/apps/api/src/lib/crawl-redis.ts). With this change, we saw a huge performance improvement on crawls. This change also allowed us to perform multiple scrape requests of one crawl at the same time, while the old crawler had no scrape concurrency. We were able to stretch a crawl over all of our machines, maximizing the worth we get for each machine we pay for. ## Goodbye Bull, hello BullMQ Every time we encountered Bull, we were slapped in the face by how much better BullMQ was. It had a better API, new features, and the most important thing of all: active maintenance. We decided to make the endeavour to switch over to it, first on Fire-Engine, and then on Firecrawl. With this change, we were able to drop the horrible code for [waiting for a job to complete](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/6798695ee4daf1ce1b289db494d260d718b6752b/apps/api/src/controllers/scrape.ts#L59-L89), and replace it all with `job.waitUntilFinished()`. We were also able to customize our workers to add Sentry instrumentation (more on that later), and to take on jobs based on CPU and RAM usage, instead of a useless max concurrency constant that we had to use with Bull. BullMQ still has its API quirks (e.g. don’t you dare call `Job.moveToCompleted` / `Job.moveToFailed` with the 3rd argument not set to `false`, otherwise you will check out and lock a job that will be returned to you that you’re probably dropping) ## Our egress fee horror story Our changes made us super scalable, but they also meant that a lot more traffic was going through Redis. We ended up racking up a 15000$ bill on Railway in August, mostly on Redis egress fees only. This wasn’t sustainable, and we needed to switch quickly. After being disappointed with Upstash, and having issues with Dragonfly, we found a way to deploy Redis to Fly.io natively. [We put our own spin on the config](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/f7c4cee404e17b3ed201e005185a5041009d0e6f/apps/redis/fly.toml), and deployed it to our account. However, we were not able to reach the instance from the public IP using `redis-cli` (netcat worked though?!?!), which caused some confusion. We decided to go another way and use Fly’s [Private Networking](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/), which provides a direct connection to a Fly app/machine without any load balancer being in front. We crafted a connection string, SSH’d into one of our worker machines, installed `redis-cli`, tried to connect, and… it worked! We had a reachable, stable Redis instance in front of us. So, we went to change the environment variable to the fancy new Fly.io Redis, we deployed the application, and… we crashed. After a quick revert, we noticed that [IORedis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis) wasn’t able to connect to the Redis instance, but `redis-cli` stilled worked fine. So… what gives? Turns out, `ioredis` only performs a lookup for an IPv4 address, unless you specify `?family=6`, in which case it only performs a lookup for an IPv6 address. This is not documented anywhere, except in a couple of GitHub issues which are hard to search for. I have been coding for almost 11 years now, and this is the worst configuration quirk I have ever seen. (And I use Nix daily!) In 2024, it would be saner to look for IPv6 by default instead of IPv4. Why not look for both? This is incomprehensible to me. Anyways, after appending `?family=6` to the string, everything worked, except, sometimes not… ## Awaiting forever We started having huge waves of scrape timeouts. After a bit of investigation, the `Job.waitUntilFinished()` Promise never returned, but after looking at our BullMQ dashboard, we saw that jobs were actually being completed. BullMQ uses Redis streams for all of its event firing/handling code, including `waitUntilFinished`, which waits until the job’s `finished` event fires. BullMQ enforces a maximum length for the event stream, in order to purge old events that have presumably already been handled, and it defaults to about 10000 maximum events. Under heavy load, our queue was firing so many events, that BullMQ was trimming events before they could be processed. This caused everything that depends on queue events to fail. This maximum events parameter is configurable, however, it seems like a parameter that we’d have to babysit, and it’s way too cryptic and too easy to forget about. Instead, we opted to rewrite the small amount of code that uses queue events to do polling instead, which is not affected by pub/sub issues like this. Inexplicably, this never happened on the old Railway Redis instance, but it happened on every alternative we tried (including Upstash and Dragonfly). We’re still not sure why we didn’t run into this issue earlier, and BullMQ queue events still work happily on the Fire-Engine side under Dragonfly. ## Adding monitoring We were growing tired of going through console logs to diagnose things. We were also worried about how many issues we could potentially be missing. So, we decided to integrate [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error and performance monitoring, because I had some great experiences with it in the past. The moment we added it, we found about 10 high-impact bugs that we had no idea about. I fixed them the day after. We also had an insight into what our services were actively doing — I was able to add custom instrumentation to BullMQ, and pass trace IDs over to Fire-Engine, so now we can view the entire process a scrape or crawl goes through until it finishes, all organized in one place. (The creation of this image for this post lead me to [decrease the time Firecrawl spends after Fire-Engine is already finished](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/commit/000a316cc362b935976ac47b73ec02923f4175c5). Thanks, Sentry!) Sentry has been immensely useful in finding errors, debugging incidents, and improving performance. There is no longer a chance that we have an issue invisibly choking us. With Sentry we see everything that could be going wrong (super exciting to see AIOps tools like [Keep](https://www.keephq.dev/) popping up). ## The future We are currently stable. I was on-call last weekend and I forgot about it. The phone never rang. It felt very weird after putting out fires for so long, but our investment absolutely paid off. It allowed us to do [our launch week](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/firecrawl-launch-week-1-recap), which would not have been possible if we were in panic mode 24/7. It has also allowed our customers to build with confidence, as the increased reliabilty adds another layer of greatness to Firecrawl. However, there are still things we’re unhappy with. Fly, while very useful early-stage, doesn’t let us smoothly autoscale. We are currently setting up Kubernetes to give us more control over our scaling. I love making Firecrawl better, be it with features or with added reliability. We’re in a good place right now, but I’m sure there will be a lot more adventures with scaling in the future. I hope this post has been useful, since surprisingly few people talk about all this stuff. (We sure had trouble finding resources when we were trying to fix things.) I will likely be back with a part 2 when there’s more exciting things to talk about.

Just a couple of years ago, Google was being openly mocked for being too late to enter the Gen AI race. Even after joining the competition, its Gemini models were, to put it very mildly, not on par with OpenAI’s flagship LLMs. But those days seem to be long over as Google recently announced truly impressive models like Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and Gemma 3. Gemma 3 deserves special attention as Google’s most ambitious open-weight model family to date. Released in March 2025, it represents a dramatic evolution from previous Gemma iterations, coming in four sizes (1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B parameters) with both pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. While the 1B model focuses on text-only processing, the larger models bring true multimodality to the table, capable of handling both images and text with impressive sophistication - a first for the Gemma series. What’s particularly striking about Gemma 3 is how it punches above its weight class. According to benchmark testing, the Gemma-3-27B-IT model outperforms Gemini 1.5-Pro across various benchmarks despite requiring dramatically fewer computational resources. The technical improvements are substantial: context windows up to 128K tokens (compared to Gemma 2’s 8K), support for 140+ languages in the larger models, and vision capabilities powered by Google’s SigLIP image encoder. These impressive capabilities make Gemma 3 an ideal candidate for specialized fine-tuning. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to use [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) to build a custom dataset and then use Unsloth to efficiently fine-tune Gemma 3 for a specific real-world use case. By the end, you’ll have hands-on experience creating a specialized AI assistant using one of Google’s most capable open models, all without breaking the bank on computational resources. ## How to Find a Dataset For Fine-tuning Gemma 3? Finding the right dataset is crucial for successful fine-tuning of any language model, including Gemma 3. The dataset should align with your intended use case and contain high-quality examples that demonstrate the behavior you want the model to learn. Here are key considerations when selecting or creating a dataset for fine-tuning: 1. **Relevance**: The dataset should closely match your target use case 2. **Quality**: Data should be clean, well-formatted, and free of errors 3. **Size**: While bigger isn’t always better, aim for at least a few thousand examples 4. **Diversity**: Include various examples covering different aspects of the desired behavior 5. **Format**: Data should follow a consistent instruction-response format ### Public datasets There are already hundreds of high-quality open-source datasets to fine-tune multimodal models like Gemma 3. For example, by [searching “multimodal” datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets?sort=likes&search=multimodal) on HuggingFace Hub, you will get over 500 results: ### Custom datasets Despite the high availability of public datasets, there are many scenarios where you might need to create your own datasets to fine-tune models for specific tasks or domains. Here are approaches to build custom datasets: 1. **Manual creation**: - Write your own instruction-response pairs - Most time-consuming but highest quality control - Ideal for specialized domains 2. **Semi-automated generation**: - Use existing LLMs to generate initial examples - Human review and editing for quality - Faster than manual creation while maintaining quality 3. **Data collection**: - Convert existing documentation or Q&A pairs - Extract from customer interactions - Transform domain-specific content into instruction format Whichever approach you choose, you will need a web scraping solution to curate initial raw data from the web. This is where [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) comes in. Firecrawl provides web scraping and crawling capabilities through an API interface. Rather than using CSS selectors or XPath expressions which can break when websites change, it uses AI-powered extraction to identify and [collect data using natural language descriptions](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint). It can also convert entire websites into a single text document under [the LLMs.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/), which is an ideal format to generate high-quality datasets for LLMs. In this article, we’ll use that exact feature to convert the documentation of the new [OpenAI Agents SDK framework](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) into a custom instruction dataset and fine-tune Gemma 3 on it (for details, see the upcoming section). ## The Tech Stack For Any Supervised LLM Fine-tuning Task To successfully fine-tune powerful models like Gemma 3, we need a robust and efficient technical infrastructure. Now that we understand Gemma 3’s capabilities and why it’s an ideal candidate for specialized fine-tuning, let’s examine the underlying tools and libraries that make this process possible. 01. [`unsloth`](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth): A library that optimizes LLM fine-tuning by reducing memory usage and training time. It provides QLoRA and other memory-efficient techniques out of the box. We will use it throughout the fine-tuning process. 02. [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub): Enables seamless integration with Hugging Face’s model hub for downloading pre-trained models and uploading fine-tuned ones. Essential for model sharing and versioning. 03. [`datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets): Provides efficient data loading and preprocessing utilities. Handles large datasets through memory mapping and streaming, with built-in support for common ML dataset formats. 04. [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): The core library for working with transformer models. Offers model architectures, tokenizers, and training utilities with a unified API across different model types. 05. [`trl`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl): (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) Specializes in fine-tuning language models through techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). 06. [`torch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch): The deep learning framework that powers the training process. Provides tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and GPU acceleration essential for model training. 07. [`wandb`](https://github.com/wandb/wandb): (Weights & Biases) A powerful experiment tracking tool that monitors training metrics, visualizes results, and helps compare different training runs. Invaluable for debugging and optimization. 08. [`accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate): A library that simplifies distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines. It handles device placement, mixed precision training, and gradient synchronization automatically. 09. [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes): Provides 8-bit optimizers and quantization methods to reduce model memory usage. Essential for training large models on consumer hardware through techniques like Int8 and FP8 quantization. 10. [`peft`](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) Implements memory-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-Tuning. Allows fine-tuning billion-parameter models on consumer GPUs by training only a small subset of parameters. Let’s examine how these libraries work together to enable LLM fine-tuning: The process starts with PyTorch ( `torch`) as the foundation - it provides the core tensor operations and automatic differentiation needed for neural network training. On top of this, the `transformers` library implements the actual model architectures and training logic specific to transformer models like Gemma 3. When loading a pre-trained model, `huggingface_hub` handles downloading the weights and configuration files from Hugging Face’s model repository. The model is then loaded into memory through `transformers`, while `bitsandbytes` applies quantization to reduce the memory footprint. For efficient fine-tuning, `peft` implements parameter-efficient methods like `LoRA` that modify only a small subset of model weights. This works in conjunction with `unsloth`, which further optimizes memory usage and training speed through techniques like `QLoRA`. The `datasets` library manages the training data, using memory mapping to efficiently handle large datasets without loading everything into RAM. It feeds batches of data to the training loop, where `trl` implements the supervised fine-tuning logic. `accelerate` coordinates the training process across available hardware resources, managing device placement and mixed precision training. It works with PyTorch’s built-in distributed training capabilities to enable multi-GPU training when available. Throughout training, `wandb` tracks and visualizes metrics like loss and accuracy in real-time, storing this data for later analysis and comparison between different training runs. This integrated stack allows you to fine-tune billion-parameter models on consumer hardware by: 1. Loading and quantizing the base model efficiently 2. Applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques 3. Managing training data and hardware resources 4. Tracking training progress and results Each component handles a specific aspect of the fine-tuning process while working seamlessly with the others through standardized APIs and data formats. As you continue with the tutorial, you will see most of these libraries used to fine-tune our own Gemma 3 model. ## Creating a Custom QA Dataset For Gemma Fine-tuning process always starts with a dataset. If you couldn’t find a public dataset for your specific use-case, we will show you how to build a custom one in this section. The idea is that we want to go from a data source such as a documentation website: to a flat JSON file containing question-answer pairs that teach an LLM how to answer questions about our custom data source: As you can see, we’ve already captured the Agents SDK’s documentation in the form of hundreds of question-answer pairs and uploaded it as a [dataset to HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bexgboost/openai-agents-python-qa-firecrawl/viewer). Each pair will teach Gemma a key piece of information about the documentation and the framework’s syntax. You can find the full code of how we implemented this process [from our GitHub repository](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/gemma-custom-fine-tune/src/dataset). Here, we will only explore a high-level overview of the steps we took. ### Generating LLMs.txt [Our first script, `scrape.py`](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/gemma-custom-fine-tune/src/dataset/scrape.py), takes a website URL as input: ```python # ... the rest of the script if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Example usage url = \"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/\" output_file = \"full_text.md\" result = scrape_website(url, output_file, max_urls=100) ``` and converts all its contents to a single markdown document that looks like this: The core functionality of the script is the `async_generate_llms_text` function of the [Firecrawl API](https://firecrawl.dev/): ```python from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp # Initialize the client firecrawl = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"your_api_key\") params = { \"maxUrls\": 10, # Maximum URLs to analyze \"showFullText\": True # Include full text in results } # Create async job job = firecrawl.async_generate_llms_text( url=\"https://example.com\", params=params ) if job['success']: job_id = job['id'] # Check LLMs.txt generation status status = firecrawl.check_generate_llms_text_status(\"job_id\") # Print current status print(f\"Status: {status['status']}\") if status['status'] == 'completed': print(\"LLMs.txt Content:\", status['data']['llmstxt']) if 'llmsfulltxt' in status['data']: print(\"Full Text Content:\", status['data']['llmsfulltxt']) print(f\"Processed URLs: {len(status['data']['processedUrls'])}\") ``` The above example shows how to use this method to scrape 10 pages of a sample URL. In our script, we set the maximum number of URLs to 100 to capture the entire documentation website. ### Chunking the dataset In this step, we take the markdown file generated by the scraper and chunk it into a JSON dataset that looks like this (see [`chunk.py` from our repository](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/gemma-custom-fine-tune/src/dataset/chunk.py)): These chunks are generated by splitting the markdown document [using LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterSplitter`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/): ```python from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter # Load example document with open(\"full_text.md\") as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=256, ) ``` The created chunks are not perfect - they may contain half-sentences, incorrect formatting, and unnecessary characters. For this reason, we pass them to OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model to improve their coherence. Here is a function we use for this task in `chunk.py`: ```python def improve_chunk_coherence(...): prompt = f\"\"\" You are a helpful assistant that improves the coherence of text. Please improve the coherence of the following text: {text} If the text contains code blocks, don't change the code. Wrap it in triple backticks along with the programming language. Don't make up facts or hallucinate. Your job is to make the text more coherent and easier to understand, only. If the text contains URLs or hyperlinks, remove them while preserving their text. For example: [This is a link](https://www.example.com) -> This is a link Only return the improved text, no other text or commentary. \"\"\" try: response = client.responses.create( model=model, input=prompt, ) return response.output_text except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Error improving chunk coherence: {e}\") # Return original text if improvement fails return text ``` In this function, the most important step is the correct use of a system prompt. Then, we process the chunks in parallel using multiple threads to speed up the execution. The final result is the JSON file you saw in the beginning containing the chunk text and a unique identifier: ```json [\\ {\\ \"content\": \"# OpenAI Agents Quickstart\\n\\n#...\",\\ \"chunk_id\": \"5b178182-381c-4882-a3b1-a9387a8809dd\"\\ },\\ ...\\ ] ``` ### Generating QA pairs After we have a chunked dataset, we want to create 5 QA pairs from each chunk. These pairs must teach something new to the LLM about the Agents SDK in a compatible format. In practice, the logic of the chunking and QA pair generation steps is the most important aspect of your entire fine-tuning process. You must consider various factors like: - The correct chunking strategy, including chunk size and quality - The system prompt for chunking - The system prompt for QA generation - The number of QA pairs to generate for each chunk - The overall dataset size and so on. I would recommend that you spend most of your time figuring out these details as the quality of the dataset is crucial for getting a high-performing fine-tuned model. [In `generate_qa_pairs.py` script](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/gemma-custom-fine-tune/src/dataset/generate_qa_pairs.py), we choose these configurations mostly at random for demonstration purposes. After we run the script, we get a new JSON file containing our final dataset: Here is the system prompt we used for QA pair generation: ```python PROMPT = \"\"\" You are an expert at generating question-answer pairs from a given text. For each given text, you must generate 5 QA pairs. Your generated questions-answer pairs will be fed into an LLM to train it on how to use the new OpenAI Agents SDK Python library. In each question-answer pair, you must try to teach as much about the Agents SDK as possible to the LLM. Generate the pairs in a way that you would want be taught this new Agents SDK Python library. Additional instructions: - Your questions must not contain references to the text itself. - Keep the difficulty of questions to hard. - If the text contains code blocks, you must generate pairs that contain coding question-answers as we want the LLM to learn how to use the Agents SDK in Python. - Don't generate pairs about the specific variables, functions or classes in code examples in the given text. Instead, generate coding snippets that are generic and aid the LLM's understanding of the Agents SDK's Python syntax. - Wrap the code snippets in triple backticks with the programming language. Here is the text: {text} \"\"\" ``` Besides, the script also implements rate-limiting and retry mechanisms to respect OpenAI’s servers and ensure fail-proof pair generation. In the final [upload\\_to\\_hf.py script](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-app-examples/tree/main/gemma-custom-fine-tune/src/dataset/upload_to_hf.py), we pushed the dataset to HuggingFace under the name “bexgboost/openai-agents-python-qa-firecrawl”. You can explore it [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bexgboost/openai-agents-python-qa-firecrawl/viewer?views%5B%5D=train). If you want to dive deeper into how this process of creating instruction datasets work, you can check out our [separate article on our blog](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/custom-instruction-datasets-llm-fine-tuning). ## Step-by-step guide to fine-tuning Gemma 3 with Unsloth AI This section walks you through the complete process of fine-tuning Google’s Gemma 3 language model using Unsloth AI’s optimization techniques. We’ll cover environment setup, model loading, dataset preprocessing, trainer configuration, and finally training and testing the model. I recommend following along the code in Google Colab as it offers T4 GPUs with 16GB vRAM. ### 1\\. Environment setup The first step involves installing all the necessary libraries for our fine-tuning task: ```python %%capture !pip install -U datasets !pip install -U accelerate !pip install -U peft !pip install -U trl !pip install -U bitsandbytes !pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@v4.49.0-Gemma-3 !pip install -q unsloth !pip install -q --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git ``` Here’s what each package does: - **datasets**: HuggingFace’s library for efficiently loading, processing, and managing datasets - **accelerate**: Simplifies distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines - **peft**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library that implements memory-efficient methods like LoRA - **trl**: Transformer Reinforcement Learning library for fine-tuning language models - **bitsandbytes**: Provides quantization techniques to reduce model memory usage - **transformers**: HuggingFace’s main library for working with transformer models - **unsloth**: A specialized library that optimizes LLM fine-tuning by reducing memory usage and training time Note that we’re installing a specific version of transformers compatible with Gemma 3, and installing unsloth directly from its GitHub repository to ensure we have the latest features. Next, we authenticate with the HuggingFace Hub to access the Gemma 3 model: ```python from huggingface_hub import login hf_token = \"hf_YOUR_TOKEN\" login(hf_token) ``` The `login()` function authenticates your HuggingFace credentials, allowing you to download models that require authentication, like Gemma 3. You can generate your own token from your [HuggingFace settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) page. ### 2\\. Loading the model and the tokenizer Now we’ll load the Gemma 3 model and its tokenizer using Unsloth’s optimized loading: ```python from unsloth import FastModel model, tokenizer = FastModel.from_pretrained( model_name = \"unsloth/gemma-3-12b-it\", max_seq_length = 2048, # Choose any for long context load_in_4bit = True, # 4 bit quantization to reduce memory full_finetuning = False, token=hf_token ) ``` Let’s break down what’s happening: - **FastModel.from\\_pretrained()**: Unsloth’s optimized method for loading models faster and with less memory than standard HuggingFace loading - **model\\_name**: We’re using the instruction-tuned (it) version of Gemma 3 with 12 billion parameters from Unsloth. Due to usage limits in Colab, we can’t choose the full 27B version - **max\\_seq\\_length**: Sets the maximum sequence length to 2048 tokens, which determines how much context the model can handle at once - **load\\_in\\_4bit**: Enables 4-bit quantization, dramatically reducing memory requirements at the cost of minimal precision loss - **full\\_finetuning**: Set to False to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning instead of updating all model weights - **token**: Your HuggingFace token for model access This function returns two important objects: 1. **model**: The loaded Gemma 3 model 2. **tokenizer**: The tokenizer that converts text to tokens and back The 4-bit quantization is particularly important as it allows fine-tuning large models like Gemma 3 (12B parameters) on consumer GPUs with limited VRAM. ### 3\\. Preprocessing the dataset Next, we load our custom dataset and prepare it for fine-tuning: ```python from datasets import load_dataset dataset_name = \"bexgboost/openai-agents-python-qa-firecrawl\" dataset = load_dataset( dataset_name, split = \"train\", trust_remote_code=True ) ``` - **load\\_dataset()**: HuggingFace’s function to load datasets from their hub - **dataset\\_name**: The path to our custom dataset on HuggingFace Hub - **split**: We’re using only the “train” split of the dataset - **trust\\_remote\\_code**: Allows execution of code that might be included with the dataset Now we need to format our dataset into the structure expected by Gemma 3: ```python EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token def format_instruction(example): prompt = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. Before answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response. ### Instruction: You are a web scraping expert with advanced knowledge in Firecrawl, which is an AI-based web-scraping engine. Please answer the following question about Firecrawl. ### Question: {} ### Response: {}\"\"\" return { \"text\": prompt.format(example['question'], example['answer']) + EOS_TOKEN } dataset = dataset.map(format_instruction) ``` This code does several important things: - **EOS\\_TOKEN**: Gets the end-of-sequence token from the tokenizer, which signals the model to stop generating text - **format\\_instruction()**: A function that transforms each dataset example into a structured instruction format - **prompt**: The template that formats our data in a way that Gemma 3 understands, with placeholders for questions and answers - **dataset.map()**: Applies our formatting function to every example in the dataset The prompt template follows a specific structure that Gemma 3 was instruction-tuned to understand, with clear sections for instructions, questions, and responses. Finally, we tokenize the formatted dataset: ```python def tokenize_function(examples): return tokenizer(examples[\"text\"], padding=False) # Manually preprocess and tokenize processed_dataset = dataset.map( tokenize_function, batched=True, remove_columns=[\"text\"], # Remove original text column desc=\"Tokenizing dataset\" ) ``` - **tokenize\\_function()**: Converts text examples into token IDs that the model understands - **tokenizer()**: The actual tokenization function from the tokenizer we loaded earlier - **padding=False**: No padding is applied at this stage (will be handled by the trainer) - **batched=True**: Process examples in batches for efficiency - **remove\\_columns=\\[“text”\\]**: Removes the original text column to save memory - **desc**: Description for the progress bar After this step, our dataset contains tokenized examples ready for training. ### 4\\. Setting up the SFTTrainer Now we prepare our model for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using LoRA: ```python model = FastModel.get_peft_model( model, r=8, target_modules=[\\ \"q_proj\",\\ \"k_proj\",\\ \"v_proj\",\\ \"o_proj\",\\ \"gate_proj\",\\ \"up_proj\",\\ \"down_proj\",\\ ], finetune_vision_layers = False, # Turn off for just text! finetune_language_layers = True, # Should leave on! finetune_attention_modules = True, # Attention good for GRPO finetune_mlp_modules = True, # Should leave on always! lora_alpha=8, lora_dropout=0, bias=\"none\", use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\", # True or \"unsloth\" for very long context random_state=1000, use_rslora=False ) ``` This code configures LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique: - **r=8**: The rank of the LoRA matrices (lower values = fewer parameters but less expressivity) - **target\\_modules**: The specific model layers to apply LoRA to, focusing on attention and MLP components - **finetune\\_vision\\_layers**: Disabled because we’re only working with text - **finetune\\_language\\_layers**: Enabled to fine-tune the language understanding capabilities - **finetune\\_attention\\_modules**: Enabled to fine-tune attention mechanisms (important for question answering) - **finetune\\_mlp\\_modules**: Enabled to fine-tune multilayer perceptrons - **lora\\_alpha**: Scaling factor for the LoRA updates (higher values = stronger updates) - **lora\\_dropout**: Dropout rate for LoRA layers (0 = no dropout) - **bias**: Whether to train bias terms (“none” = don’t train) - **use\\_gradient\\_checkpointing**: Memory optimization technique, set to Unsloth’s implementation - **random\\_state**: Random seed for reproducibility - **use\\_rslora**: Whether to use rank-stabilized LoRA (disabled here) Next, we set up the Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer: ```python from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig trainer = SFTTrainer( model = model, tokenizer = tokenizer, train_dataset = processed_dataset, eval_dataset = None, # Can set up evaluation! args = SFTConfig( dataset_text_field = \"text\", dataset_kwargs = {\"skip_prepare_dataset\": True}, per_device_train_batch_size = 2, gradient_accumulation_steps = 4, warmup_steps = 5, num_train_epochs = 2, learning_rate = 2e-4, logging_steps = 5, optim = \"adamw_8bit\", weight_decay = 0.01, lr_scheduler_type = \"linear\", seed = 3407, report_to = \"none\", ), ) ``` The `SFTTrainer` handles the fine-tuning process: - **model**: Our PEFT-configured model - **tokenizer**: Our tokenizer - **train\\_dataset**: Our processed dataset - **eval\\_dataset**: No evaluation dataset provided (could be added for monitoring) - **args**: Configuration for training via SFTConfig: - **dataset\\_text\\_field**: The name of the text field in our dataset - **dataset\\_kwargs**: Additional dataset processing arguments - **per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size**: Number of examples per GPU (small due to model size) - **gradient\\_accumulation\\_steps**: Accumulate gradients across multiple batches to simulate larger batches - **warmup\\_steps**: Number of steps to gradually increase learning rate - **num\\_train\\_epochs**: Total training epochs (2 is often sufficient for LoRA fine-tuning) - **learning\\_rate**: Learning rate for optimization (2e-4 is relatively high for LoRA fine-tuning) - **logging\\_steps**: How often to log training metrics - **optim**: Optimizer to use (adamw\\_8bit for memory efficiency) - **weight\\_decay**: L2 regularization strength - **lr\\_scheduler\\_type**: Learning rate schedule type - **seed**: Random seed for reproducibility - **report\\_to**: Disable external reporting These parameters are carefully balanced to provide effective fine-tuning while managing memory constraints and preventing overfitting. ### 5\\. Model training and testing With everything set up, we can now train our model: ```python trainer.train() ``` This single line kicks off the entire training process. The `train()` method will: 1. Prepare batches from our dataset 2. Feed them through the model 3. Calculate loss based on prediction errors 4. Backpropagate gradients 5. Update the LoRA parameters 6. Log progress and metrics The training will run for 2 epochs as specified, with all the configuration we’ve set up previously. After training completes, we can test our fine-tuned model: ```python from transformers import TextStreamer prompt = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: {} ### Response: {} \"\"\" FastModel.for_inference(model) instruction = \"How do you create an agent using OpenAI Agents SDK?\" message = prompt.format(instruction, \"\") inputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\") text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) _ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_streamer, max_new_tokens=512, use_cache=True) ``` This test code: - **FastModel.for\\_inference()**: Prepares the model for efficient inference - **prompt**: Creates a template similar to our training format - **instruction**: A test question about the OpenAI Agents SDK - **message**: Formats our instruction into the prompt template - **inputs**: Tokenizes the message and moves it to the GPU - **TextStreamer**: Creates a streamer that will print tokens as they’re generated - **model.generate()**: Runs text generation with our model - **streamer**: Uses the text streamer to display results in real time - **max\\_new\\_tokens**: Limits generation to 512 new tokens - **use\\_cache**: Enables key-value caching for faster generation Here is the model’s response to our question: Unfortunately, the model is widely off-the-mark here. The output is not great, the model now correctly recognizes the Agents framework but the syntax is incorrect. This can be due to various factors such as low dataset quality, smaller dataset size, bad tuning parameters, and other issues we didn’t spend much time optimizing. These limitations highlight the importance of high-quality training data and careful parameter selection when fine-tuning language models. ## Conclusion This guide has walked you through the complete process of fine-tuning Gemma 3 using Unsloth AI’s optimization techniques. By using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and memory-saving approaches like 4-bit quantization, we can fine-tune large language models even on consumer hardware. The key advantages of this approach include: - Reduced memory requirements through quantization and gradient checkpointing - Faster training through Unsloth’s optimizations - Minimal parameters to update through LoRA - Simple workflow through integrated libraries like TRL While our example focused on a specific dataset about the OpenAI Agents SDK, this same approach can be applied to any domain-specific dataset for creating specialized AI assistants.

Whether you’re tracking prices, monitoring competitors, or gathering research data, automated web scraping can save you countless hours of manual work. In this comprehensive guide, you’ll learn how to schedule and automate your Python web scrapers using completely free tools and services. ### Why automate your web scraper? Manual or one-off web scraping can be time-consuming and error-prone. You need to repeatedly run scripts, update data frequently, and sometimes work during off-hours just to gather information. Scheduling your web scrapers automates this entire process. It collects data at optimal times without manual intervention, ensures consistency, and frees up your valuable time for actual data analysis rather than repetitive data gathering. ### What tools can you use to automate web scrapers in Python? If you are building scrapers in Python, you have many completely free options to schedule them. In terms of local scraping, Python’s `schedule` library is very intuitive and fastest to set up. There is also the built-in `asyncio` for concurrent scraping. There are also system-level automation tools like cron jobs for macOS/Linux and the Task Scheduler for Windows. There are also many cloud-based solutions like GitHub Actions (completely free), PythonAnywhere (free tier), Google Cloud Functions (free tier), and Heroku (free tier with limitations). In this guide, we will start with basic local scheduling and progress to using GitHub Actions, all while following best practices and ethical scraping guidelines. Let’s begin by setting up your development environment and writing your first scheduled web scraper. ### Common challenges in automating web scrapers Scheduling web scrapers is an easy process, as you will discover through this tutorial. The real challenge lies in ensuring that the scrapers don’t break the day after they are put on schedule. Common issues include websites changing their HTML structure, implementing new anti-bot measures, or modifying their robots.txt policies. Additionally, network issues, rate limiting, and IP blocking can cause scheduled scrapers to fail. For these reasons, it is almost impossible to build long-lasting scrapers written in Python frameworks. But the web scraping landscape is changing as more AI-based tools are emerging, like [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/). Firecrawl provides an AI-powered web scraping API that can identify and extract data from HTML elements based on semantic descriptions in Python classes. While traditional scrapers rely on specific HTML selectors that can break when websites change, Firecrawl’s AI approach helps maintain scraper reliability over time. For demonstration purposes, we’ll implement examples using Firecrawl, though the scheduling techniques covered in this tutorial can be applied to any Python web scraper built with common libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, or `lxml`. If you want to follow along with a scraper of your own, make sure to have it in a script and ready to go. ## Prerequisites This article assumes that you are already comfortable with web scraping and its related concepts like HTML structure, CSS selectors, HTTP requests, and handling rate limits. If you need a refresher on web scraping basics, check out [this introductory guide to web scraping with Python](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/). Otherwise, let’s jump in by setting up the tools we will use for the tutorial. ### Environment setup We will mainly use Firecrawl in this article, so, please make sure that you sign up at [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/), choose the free plan and get an API token. Then, create a new working directory on your machine to follow along in this tutorial: ```bash mkdir learn-scheduling cd learn-scheduling ``` It is always a best practice to create a new virtual environment for projects. In this tutorial, we will use Python’s `virtualenv`: ```bash python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # For Unix/macOS venv\\Scripts\\activate # For Windows ``` Now, let’s install the libraries we will use: ```bash pip install requests beautifulsoup4 firecrawl-py python-dotenv ``` We will touch on what each library does as we use them. ### Firecrawl API key setup Since we will push our code to a GitHub repository later, you will need to save your Firecrawl API key securely by using a `.env` file: ```bash touch .env echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your-key-here'\" >> .env ``` Also, create a `.gitignore` file and add the `.env` to it so that it isn’t pushed to GitHub: ```bash touch .gitignore echo \".env\" >> .gitignore ``` ## Writing a Basic Web Scraper In this tutorial, we will build a scraper for [the Hacker News homepage](https://news.ycombinator.com/) that extracts post title, URL, author, rank, number of upvotes and date. Like we mentioned, we will build the scraper in Firecrawl but I have also prepared an [identical scraper written in BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/tree/main/examples/blog-articles/scheduling_scrapers) if you want a more traditional approach. In your working directory, create a new `firecrawl_scraper.py` script and import the following packages: ```python # firecrawl_scraper.py import json from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from typing import List from datetime import datetime load_dotenv() BASE_URL = \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" ``` After the imports, we are calling `load_dotenv()` so that our Firecrawl API key is loaded from the `.env` file. Then, we are defining a new variable containing the URL we will scrape. Next, we create a Pydantic model to specify the information we want to scrape from each Hacker News post: ```python class NewsItem(BaseModel): title: str = Field(description=\"The title of the news item\") source_url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the news item\") author: str = Field( description=\"The URL of the post author's profile concatenated with the base URL.\" ) rank: str = Field(description=\"The rank of the news item\") upvotes: str = Field(description=\"The number of upvotes of the news item\") date: str = Field(description=\"The date of the news item.\") ``` Pydantic models are Python classes that provide data validation and serialization capabilities. They allow you to define the structure and types of your data using Python type hints, while automatically handling validation, serialization, and documentation. In the context of our Firecrawl scraper, the `NewsItem` model defines the exact structure of data we want to extract from each Hacker News post. Each field in the model ( `title`, `source_url`, `author`, etc.) specifies what data should be scraped and includes a description of what that field represents. This model is crucial for Firecrawl because it uses the model’s schema to understand exactly what data to extract from the webpage. When we pass this model to Firecrawl, it will automatically attempt to find and extract data matching these field definitions from the HTML structure of Hacker News. For example, when Firecrawl sees we want a “title” field, it will look for elements on the page that are likely to contain post titles based on their HTML structure and content. The `Field` descriptions help provide additional context about what each piece of data represents. Next, we create another model called `NewsData` that contains a list of `NewsItem` objects. This model will serve as a container for all the news items we scrape from Hacker News. The `news_items` field is defined as a List of `NewsItem` objects, which means it can store multiple news items in a single data structure. ```python class NewsData(BaseModel): news_items: List[NewsItem] ``` Without this second model, our scraper will return not one but all news items. Now, we define a new function that will run Firecrawl based on the scraping schema we just defined: ```python def get_firecrawl_news_data(): app = FirecrawlApp() data = app.scrape_url( BASE_URL, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": {\"schema\": NewsData.model_json_schema()}, }, ) return data ``` This function initializes a FirecrawlApp instance and uses it to scrape data from Hacker News. It passes the `BASE_URL` and parameters specifying that we want to extract data according to our `NewsData` schema. The schema tells Firecrawl exactly what fields to look for and extract from each news item on the page. The function returns the scraped data which will contain a list of news items matching our defined structure. Let’s quickly test it: ```python data = get_firecrawl_news_data() print(type(data)) ``` ```python ``` Firecrawl always returns the scraped data in a dictionary. Let’s look at the keys: ```python data['metadata'] ``` ```python { 'title': 'Hacker News', 'language': 'en', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'referrer': 'origin', 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0', 'sourceURL': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/', 'url': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/', 'statusCode': 200 } ``` The first key is the metadata field containing basic page information. We are interested in the `extract` field which contains the data scraped by the engine: ```python data['extract']['news_items'][0] ``` ```python { 'title': \"Send someone you appreciate an official 'Continue and Persist' Letter\", 'source_url': 'https://ContinueAndPersist.org', 'author': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adnanaga', 'rank': '1', 'upvotes': '1122', 'date': '17 hours ago' } ``` The `extract` field contains a dictionary with a list of scraped news items. We can see above that when printing the first item, it includes all the fields we defined in our `NewsItem` Pydantic model, including title, source URL, author, rank, upvotes and date. ```python len(data['extract']['news_items']) ``` ```python 30 ``` The output shows 30 news items, confirming that our scraper successfully extracted all posts from the first page of Hacker News. This matches the site’s standard layout which displays exactly 30 posts per page. Now, let’s create a new function that saves this data to a JSON file: ```python def save_firecrawl_news_data(): # Get the data data = get_firecrawl_news_data() # Format current date for filename date_str = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M\") filename = f\"firecrawl_hacker_news_data_{date_str}.json\" # Save the news items to JSON file with open(filename, \"w\") as f: json.dump(data[\"extract\"][\"news_items\"], f, indent=4) return filename ``` `save_firecrawl_news_data()` handles saving the scraped Hacker News data to a JSON file. It first calls `get_firecrawl_news_data()` to fetch the latest data from Hacker News. Then, it generates a filename using the current timestamp in the format `YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM`. The data is saved to this timestamped JSON file with proper indentation, and the filename is returned. This allows us to maintain a historical record of the scraped data with clear timestamps indicating when each scrape occurred. Finally, add a `__main__` block to the `firecrawl_scraper.py` script to allow running the scraper directly from the command line: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": save_firecrawl_news_data() ``` The complete scraper script is available in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/examples/hacker_news_scraper/firecrawl_scraper.py). For reference, we also provide [a BeautifulSoup implementation of the same scraper](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/examples/hacker_news_scraper/bs4_scraper.py). ## Local Web Scraping Automation Methods In this section, we will explore how to run the scraper from the previous section on schedule using local tools like the Python `schedule` library and cron. ### The basics of the Python `schedule` library `schedule` is a job scheduling library written for humans ( [from the documentation](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)). It runs any Python function or callable periodically using intuitive syntax. To get started, please install it with `pip`: ```bash pip install schedule ``` Then, scheduling a Python function is as easy as shown in the codeblock below: ```python import schedule import time def job(): current_time = time.strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\") print(f\"{current_time}: I'm working...\") # Schedule it schedule.every(3).seconds.do(job) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1) ``` ```out 14:58:23: I'm working... 14:58:26: I'm working... 14:58:29: I'm working... 14:58:32: I'm working... 14:58:35: I'm working... ... ``` To implement scheduling, first convert your task into a function (which we’ve already completed). Next, apply scheduling logic using the `.every(n).period.do` syntax. Below are several examples demonstrating different scheduling patterns: ```python schedule.every(10).minutes.do(job) schedule.every().hour.do(job) schedule.every().day.at(\"10:30\").do(job) schedule.every().monday.do(job) schedule.every().wednesday.at(\"13:15\").do(job) schedule.every().day.at(\"12:42\", \"Europe/Amsterdam\").do(job) schedule.every().minute.at(\":17\").do(job) # 17th second of a minute ``` Finally, you need to run an infinite loop that checks for pending scheduled jobs and executes them. The loop below runs continuously, checking if any scheduled tasks are due to run: ```python while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1) ``` There is much more to the `schedule` library than what we just covered (you should check out [the examples from the documentation](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html)) but they are enough for the purposes of this article. ### Using Python’s `schedule` library to schedule web scrapers Now that we know the basics of `schedule`, let’s use it for our Firecrawl scraper. Start by creating a new `scrape_scheduler.py` script and making the necessary imports: ```python import schedule import time from firecrawl_scraper import save_firecrawl_news_data ``` Here, we import the `schedule` module itself and the `save_firecrawl_news_data()` function from `firecrawl_scraper.py` that downloads the top 30 posts of Hacker News. Then, to run this function on schedule, like every hour, we only need to add a few lines of code: ```python # Schedule the scraper to run every hour schedule.every().hour.do(save_firecrawl_news_data) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1) ``` You can start the schedule with: ```bash python scrape_scheduler.py ``` > **Tip**: For debugging purposes, start with a shorter interval like 60 seconds before implementing the hourly schedule. The scheduler will continue running until you terminate the main terminal process executing the `scrape_scheduler.py` script. Thanks to Firecrawl’s AI-powered HTML parsing and layout adaptation capabilities, the scraper is quite resilient to website changes and has a low probability of breaking. Nevertheless, web scraping can be unpredictable, so it’s recommended to review [the exception handling](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/exception-handling.html) section of the `schedule` documentation to handle potential errors gracefully. * * * The `schedule` library provides a simple and intuitive way to run periodic tasks like web scrapers. While it lacks some advanced features of other scheduling methods, it’s a great choice for basic scheduling needs and getting started with automated scraping. Just remember to implement proper error handling for production use. ### Using Python’s built-in tools to automate web scrapers In this section, we will explore a few other local scheduling methods that have the advantage of being built into Python or the operating system, making them more reliable and robust than third-party libraries. These methods also provide better error handling, logging capabilities, and system-level control over the scheduling process. #### How to automate a web scraper with `asyncio`? `asyncio` is a Python library for running code concurrently - executing multiple tasks at the same time by switching between them when one is waiting. It’s built into Python and helps schedule tasks efficiently. Here’s why it’s great for web scrapers: 1. It can do other work while waiting for web requests to complete. 2. You can run multiple scrapers at the same time with precise timing control. 3. It uses less computer resources than regular multitasking. 4. It handles errors well with `try/except` blocks. Let’s see how to use `asyncio` for scheduling scrapers: ```python import asyncio import time from firecrawl_scraper import save_firecrawl_news_data async def schedule_scraper(interval_hours: float = 1): while True: try: print(f\"Starting scrape at {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\") # Run the scraper filename = save_firecrawl_news_data() print(f\"Data saved to {filename}\") except Exception as e: print(f\"Error during scraping: {e}\") # Wait for the specified interval await asyncio.sleep(interval_hours * 3600) # Convert hours to seconds async def main(): # Create tasks for different scheduling intervals tasks = [\\ schedule_scraper(interval_hours=1), # Run every hour\\ # Add more tasks with different intervals if needed\\ # schedule_scraper(interval_hours=0.5), # Run every 30 minutes\\ # schedule_scraper(interval_hours=2), # Run every 2 hours\\ ] # Run all tasks concurrently await asyncio.gather(*tasks) if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Run the async scheduler asyncio.run(main()) ``` Let’s break down what’s happening above: The `schedule_scraper()` function is an `async` function that runs indefinitely in a loop. For each iteration, it: 1. Runs the scraper and saves the data 2. Handles any errors that occur during scraping 3. Waits for the specified interval using `asyncio.sleep()` The `main()` function sets up concurrent execution of multiple scraper tasks with different intervals. This allows running multiple scrapers simultaneously without blocking each other. This asyncio-based approach has several advantages over the `schedule` library: 1. True concurrency: Multiple scrapers can run simultaneously without blocking each other, unlike `schedule` which runs tasks sequentially. 2. Precise Timing: `asyncio.sleep()` provides more accurate timing control compared to schedule’s `run_pending()` approach. 3. Resource Efficiency: `asyncio` uses cooperative multitasking which requires less system resources than `schedule`’s threading-based approach. 4. Better Error Handling: `Async/await` makes it easier to implement proper error handling and recovery 5. Flexibility: You can easily add or remove scraper tasks and modify their intervals without affecting other tasks The code structure also makes it simple to extend functionality by adding more concurrent tasks or implementing additional error handling logic. #### How to automate a web scraper with cron jobs? Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS). Think of it as a digital scheduler or calendar that can automatically run programs at specified times. A cron job is simply a task that you schedule to run at specific intervals. For web scraping, cron jobs are incredibly useful because they let you automate your scraper to run at predetermined times. For example, you could set up a cron job to: - Run your scraper every hour to collect real-time data - Execute scraping tasks during off-peak hours (like 2 AM) to minimize server load - Collect data at specific times when websites update their content The scheduling format uses five time fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. For instance: - `0 * * * *` means “run every hour at minute 0” - `0 0 * * *` means “run at midnight every day” - `*/15 * * * *` means “run every 15 minutes” Cron jobs are especially reliable for web scraping because they’re built into the operating system, use minimal resources, and continue running even after system reboots. So, let’s run the `save_firecrawl_news_data()` function on a schedule using cron. First, we will create a dedicated script for the cron job named `cron_scraper.py`: ```python # cron_scraper.py import sys import logging from datetime import datetime from pathlib import Path from firecrawl_scraper import save_firecrawl_news_data # Set up logging log_dir = Path(\"logs\") log_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True) log_file = log_dir / f\"scraper_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y_%m')}.log\" logging.basicConfig( level=logging.INFO, format=\"%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\", handlers=[logging.FileHandler(log_file), logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)], ) def main(): try: logging.info(\"Starting scraping job\") filename = save_firecrawl_news_data() # Actual scraping function logging.info(f\"Successfully saved data to {filename}\") except Exception as e: logging.error(f\"Scraping failed: {str(e)}\", exc_info=True) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() ``` The script implements a production-ready web scraper with logging and error handling. It creates a logs directory, configures detailed logging to both files and console, and wraps the scraping operation in error handling. When run, it executes our scraper function while tracking its progress and any potential issues, making it ideal for automated scheduling through cron jobs. Now, to schedule this script using cron, you will need to make it executable: ```bash chmod +x cron_scraper.py ``` Then, open your crontab file (which is usually empty) with Nano: ```bash EDITOR=nano crontab -e ``` Then, add one or more entries specifying the frequency with which the scraper must run: ```python # Run every minute */1 * * * * cd /absolute/path/to/project && /absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python cron_scraper.py >> ~/cron.log 2>&1 # Run every hour */1 * * * * cd /absolute/path/to/project && /absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python cron_scraper.py >> ~/cron.log 2>&1 ``` The above cron job syntax consists of several parts: The timing pattern “ _/1_ \\*\\* \\*” breaks down as follows: - First `*/1`: Specifies every minute - First `*`: Represents any hour - Second `*`: Represents any day of the month - Third `*`: Represents any month - Fourth `*`: Represents any day of the week After the timing pattern: - `cd /absolute/path/to/project`: Changes to the project directory of your scraper - `&&`: Chains commands, executing the next only if previous succeeds - `/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python`: Specifies the Python interpreter path - `cron_scraper.py`: The script to execute - `>> ~/cron.log 2>&1`: Redirects both standard output (>>) and errors ( `2>&1`) to `cron.log` For hourly execution, the same pattern applies but with `0 * * * *` timing to run at the start of each hour instead of every minute. As soon as you save your crontab file with these commands, the schedule starts and you should see a `logs` directory in the same folder as your `cron_scraper.py`. It must look like this if you have been following along: You can always check the status of your cron jobs with the following command as well: ```bash tail -f ~/cron.log ``` To cancel a cron job, simply open your crontab file again and remove the line corresponding to the job. #### How to automate a web scraper using Windows Task Scheduler? Windows Task Scheduler is a built-in Windows tool that can automate running programs or scripts at specified times. It’s a robust alternative to cron jobs for Windows users. Let’s set up our scraper to run automatically. First, create a batch file ( `run_scraper.bat`) to run our Python script: ```python @echo off cd /d \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\" call venv\\Scripts\\activate python cron_scraper.py deactivate ``` Then, to set up the task in Windows Task Scheduler: - Open Task Scheduler (search “Task Scheduler” in Windows search) - Click “Create Basic Task” in the right panel - Follow the wizard: - Name: “Hacker News Scraper” - Description: “Scrapes Hacker News hourly” - Trigger: Choose when to run (e.g., “Daily”) - Action: “Start a program” - Program/script: Browse to your `run_scraper.bat` - Start in: Your project directory For more control over the task, you can modify its properties after creation: - Double-click the task - In the “Triggers” tab, click “Edit” to set custom schedules - Common scheduling options: - Run every hour - Run at specific times - Run on system startup - In the “Settings” tab, useful options include: - “Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed\" - \"Stop the task if it runs longer than X hours” The Task Scheduler provides several advantages: - Runs even when user is logged out - Detailed history and logging - Ability to run with elevated privileges - Options for network conditions - Retry logic for failed tasks You can monitor your scheduled task through the Task Scheduler interface or check the logs we set up in `cron_scraper.py`. ## Automating Web Scrapers With GitHub Actions One disadvantage all local scheduling methods have is that they rely on your local machine being powered on and connected to the internet. If your computer is turned off, loses power, or loses internet connectivity, your scheduled scraping tasks won’t run. This is where cloud-based solutions like GitHub Actions can provide more reliability and uptime for your web scraping workflows. ### What is GitHub Actions? GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub that allows you to automate various workflows directly from your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. For web scraping, GitHub Actions provides a reliable way to schedule and run your scraping scripts in the cloud. You can define workflows using YAML files that specify when and how your scraper should run, such as on a regular schedule using cron syntax. This means your scraping jobs will continue running even when your local machine is off, as they execute on GitHub’s servers. ### Step 1: Setting Up a GitHub repository To schedule our scrapers with GitHub actions, we first need a GitHub repository. Start by initializing Git in your current workspace: ```bash # Initialize git in your project directory git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" ``` Next, create a new public or private GitHub repository and add it as the remote: ```bash # Create a new repo on GitHub.com, then: git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main ``` Then, create the following directory structure: ```bash mkdir -p .github/workflows ``` This directory will contain our GitHub Actions workflow files with YAML format. These files define how and when our scraping scripts should run. The workflows can be scheduled using cron syntax, triggered by events like pushes or pull requests, and can include multiple steps like installing dependencies and running scripts. ### Step 2: Creating a Workflow file At this stage, create a new `scraper.yml` file inside `.github/workflows` and paste the following contents: ```yaml name: Run Firecrawl Scraper on: schedule: - cron: \"0/5 * * * *\" # Runs every five minute workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger jobs: scrape: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: \"3.9\" - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install pydantic firecrawl-py - name: Run scraper run: python firecrawl_scraper.py env: # Add any environment variables your scraper needs FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} - name: Commit and push if changes run: | git config --global user.name 'GitHub Actions Bot' git config --global user.email 'actions@github.com' git add . git commit -m \"Update scraped data\" || exit 0 git push ``` Let’s break down the key components of this GitHub Actions workflow file: Workflow name: The workflow is named “Run Firecrawl Scraper” which helps identify it in the GitHub Actions interface. Triggers: - Scheduled to run every 5 minutes using cron syntax `0/5 * * * *` (5 minutes is for debugging purposes, please change to hourly later) - Can be manually triggered using `workflow_dispatch` Job configuration: - Runs on latest Ubuntu virtual environment - Contains multiple sequential steps Step details: 1. Checkout: - Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to get repository code 2. Python Setup: - Uses `actions/setup-python@v4` - Configures Python 3.9 environment 3. Dependencies: - Upgrades `pip` - Installs required packages: `pydantic` and `firecrawl-py` 4. Scraper Execution: - Runs `firecrawl_scraper.py` - Uses `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` from repository secrets 5. Committing the changes: - Creates a commit persisting the downloaded data using GitHub Actions bot. To run this action successfully, you’ll need to store your Firecrawl API key in GitHub secrets. Navigate to your repository’s Settings, then Secrets and variables → Actions. Click the “New repository secret” button and add your API key, making sure to use the exact key name specified in `scraper.yml`. After ensuring that everything is set up correctly, commit and push the latest changes to GitHub: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add a workflow to scrape on a schedule\" ``` Once you do, the workflow must show up in the Actions tab of your repository like below: Click on the workflow name and press the “Run workflow” button. This launches the action manually and starts the schedule. If you check in after some time, you should see more automatic runs and the results persisted in your repository: Caution: I left the workflow running overnight (at five minute intervals) and was nastily surprised by 96 workflow runs the next day. Thankfully, GitHub actions are free (up to 2000 min/month) unlike AWS instances. Now, unless you disable the workflow manually by clicking the three dots in the upper-right corner, the scraper continues running on the schedule you specified. ## Best Practices and Optimization When scheduling web scrapers, following best practices ensures reliability, efficiency, and ethical behavior. Here are the key areas to consider: ### 1\\. Rate limiting and delays Scraping engines like Firecrawl usually come with built-in rate limiting. However, if you are using custom scrapers written with Python libraries, you must always respect website servers by implementing proper rate limiting and delay strategies. For example, the below example shows adding random delays between your requests in-between requests to respect server load and avoid getting your IP blocked: ```python import time import random def scrape_with_delays(urls): for url in urls: try: # Random delay between 2-5 seconds delay = random.uniform(2, 5) time.sleep(delay) # Your scraping code here response = requests.get(url) except requests.RequestException as e: logging.error(f\"Error scraping {url}: {e}\") ``` Best practices for rate limiting: - Add random delays between requests (2-5 seconds minimum) - Respect `robots.txt` directives - Implement exponential backoff for retries - Stay under 1 request per second for most sites - Monitor response headers for rate limit information ### 2\\. Proxy Rotation This best practice is related to using custom web scrapers. Proxy rotation involves cycling through different IP addresses when making requests to avoid getting blocked. By distributing requests across multiple IPs, you can maintain access to websites that might otherwise flag high-volume traffic from a single source. ```python from itertools import cycle def get_proxy_pool(): proxies = [\\ 'http://proxy1:port',\\ 'http://proxy2:port',\\ 'http://proxy3:port'\\ ] return cycle(proxies) def scrape_with_proxies(url, proxy_pool): for _ in range(3): # Max 3 retries try: proxy = next(proxy_pool) response = requests.get( url, proxies={'http': proxy, 'https': proxy}, timeout=10 ) return response except requests.RequestException: continue return None ``` Proxy best practices: - Rotate IPs regularly - Use high-quality proxy services - Implement timeout handling - Monitor proxy health - Keep backup proxies ready ### 3\\. Data Storage Strategies The example scrapers we have built today saved the data to a JSON file, which is a simple method. Based on your needs, you may consider building a full data storage solution that saves the scraped data to various formats like as CSV files or to an SQL database. The storage type always depends on the kind of information scraped. Below is an example class that can save lists of dictionaries (like we scraped today) to a CSV file: ```python from datetime import datetime import json import pandas as pd class DataManager: def __init__(self, base_path='data'): self.base_path = Path(base_path) self.base_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True) def save_data(self, data, format='csv'): timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S') if format == 'csv': filename = self.base_path / f'data_{timestamp}.csv' pd.DataFrame(data).to_csv(filename, index=False) elif format == 'json': filename = self.base_path / f'data_{timestamp}.json' with open(filename, 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=2) # Cleanup old files (keep last 7 days) self._cleanup_old_files(days=7) return filename def _cleanup_old_files(self, days): # Implementation for cleaning up old files pass ``` Storage recommendations: - Use appropriate file formats (CSV/JSON/Database) - Implement data versioning - Regular cleanup of old data - Compress historical data - Consider using a database for large datasets ### 4\\. Error Logging and Monitoring Web scraping usually requires more sophisticated logging than plain old print statements. Save the following or bookmark it on your browser as it properly sets up a logger using the built-in `logging` module of Python: ```python import logging from pathlib import Path def setup_logging(): log_dir = Path('logs') log_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True) # File handler for detailed logs file_handler = logging.FileHandler( log_dir / f'scraper_{datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")}.log' ) file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # Console handler for important messages console_handler = logging.StreamHandler() console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Configure logging logging.basicConfig( level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', handlers=[file_handler, console_handler] ) ``` Monitoring best practices: - Implement comprehensive logging - Set up alerts for critical failures - Monitor memory usage - Track success rates - Log response times ### 5\\. Maintaining Your Scraper Maintaining your web scraper is crucial for ensuring reliable and continuous data collection. Web scraping targets are dynamic - websites frequently update their structure, implement new security measures, or change their content organization. Regular maintenance helps catch these changes early, prevents scraping failures, and ensures your data pipeline remains robust. A well-maintained scraper also helps manage resources efficiently, keeps code quality high, and adapts to evolving requirements. Maintenance guidelines: - Regular code updates - Monitor site changes - Update user agents periodically - Check for library updates - Implement health checks - Document maintenance procedures ## Conclusion Throughout this guide, we’ve explored how to effectively schedule web scrapers using local Python and operation system tools as well as GitHub actions. From basic setup to advanced optimization techniques, we’ve covered the essential components needed to build reliable, automated data collection pipelines.

There are many compelling reasons to move web scrapers to the cloud and make them more reliable. This guide explores several methods for automating and deploying web scrapers in 2025, focusing on free solutions. Here is a general outline of concepts we will cover: - Setting up automated scraping with GitHub Actions - Deploying to PaaS platforms (Heroku, PythonAnywhere) - Best practices for monitoring, security, and optimization ## Why Move Web Scrapers to the Cloud? The number one reason to deploy scrapers to the cloud is reliability. Cloud-based scrapers run 24/7, without cigarette breaks and the best part, without depending on your local machine. Cloud-based scrapers also handle large-scale data operations more easily and gracefully, often juggling multiple scraping tasks. And, if you are a bit more aggressive in your request frequencies and get a dreaded IP ban, cloud services can give access to other IP addresses and geographic locations. Moreover, you are not limited by your laptop’s specs because cloud gives you dedicated resources. While these resources may gouge a hole in your pocket for large-scale scraping operations, many platforms offer generous free tiers, as we will explore soon. ## How to Choose the Right Deployment Method For Your Scrapers We are about to list three deployment methods in this article, so you might get a decision fatigue. To prevent that, give this section a cursory read as it helps you choose the right one based on your scale requirements, technical complexity, and budget. ### Scale requirements In this section, we’ll dive into three deployment tiers that match your scale - from lightweight solutions to heavy-duty scraping powerhouses. #### Small scale (1-1000 requests/day) - **Best Options**: - GitHub Actions - PythonAnywhere - Heroku (Free Tier) - **Why**: These platforms offer sufficient resources for basic scraping needs without cost - **Limitations**: Daily request caps and runtime restrictions #### Medium Scale (1000-10000 requests/day) - **Best Options**: - AWS Lambda - Google Cloud Functions - Docker containers on basic VPS - **Why**: Better handling of concurrent requests and flexible scaling - **Considerations**: Cost begins to factor in, but still manageable #### Large Scale (10000+ requests/day) - **Best Options**: - Kubernetes clusters - Multi-region serverless deployments - Specialized scraping platforms - **Why**: Robust infrastructure for high-volume operations - **Trade-offs**: Higher complexity and cost vs. reliability ### Technical complexity Now, let’s categorize the methods based on how fast you can get them up and running. #### Low Complexity Solutions - **GitHub Actions** - Pros: Simple setup, version control integration - Cons: Limited customization - **PythonAnywhere** - Pros: User-friendly interface - Cons: Resource constraints #### Medium Complexity Solutions - **Serverless (AWS Lambda/Google Functions)** - Pros: Managed infrastructure, auto-scaling - Cons: Learning curve for configuration - **Docker Containers** - Pros: Consistent environments - Cons: Container management overhead #### High Complexity Solutions - **Kubernetes** - Pros: Ultimate flexibility and scalability - Cons: Significant operational overhead - **Custom Infrastructure** - Pros: Complete control - Cons: Requires DevOps expertise ### Budget Considerations In terms of cost, all methods in the article has the following generous free tiers or next-to-nothing cheap starting plans: - GitHub Actions: 2000 minutes/month - Heroku: $5 and up - AWS Lambda: starting at 0.2$ per 1 million requests - Google Cloud Functions: 2 million invocations/month These limits are based on various cost factors like compute time, data transfer speeds, storage requirements and additional services like databases or monitoring. Here is a little decision matrix to distill all this information: | Factor | Small Project | Medium Project | Large Project | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Best Platform | GitHub Actions | AWS Lambda | Kubernetes | | Monthly Cost | $0 | $10-50 | $100+ | | Setup Time | 1-2 hours | 1-2 days | 1-2 weeks | | Maintenance | Minimal | Moderate | Significant | | Scalability | Limited | Good | Excellent | * * * Start small with simpler platforms and gather data on your scraping needs by measuring actual usage patterns. From there, you can gradually scale and potentially implement hybrid approaches that balance complexity and benefits. ## Prerequisites This article assumes familiarity with web scraping fundamentals like HTML parsing, CSS selectors, HTTP requests, and handling dynamic content. You should also be comfortable with Python basics including functions, loops, and working with external libraries. Basic knowledge of command line tools and git version control will be essential for deployment. ### Required accounts Before starting with any deployment method, you’ll need to create accounts on these platforms: 1. **[GitHub account](https://github.com/)** (Required) - Needed for version control and GitHub Actions 2. **Cloud Platform Account** (Choose at least one) - [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) - [PythonAnywhere account](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) 3. **[Firecrawl account](https://firecrawl.dev/)** (Optional) - Only needed if you decide to use an AI-based scraper (more on Firecrawl soon). Note: Most cloud platforms require a credit card for verification, even when using free tiers. However, they won’t charge you unless you exceed free tier limits. ### Building a basic scraper To demonstrate deployment concepts effectively, we’ll start by building a basic web scraper using Firecrawl, a modern scraping API that simplifies many common challenges. [Firecrawl](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/) offers several key advantages compared to traditional Python web scraping libraries: - Dead simple to use with only a few dependencies - Handles complex scraping challenges automatically (proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic JS content) - Converts web content into clean, LLM-ready markdown format - Supports multiple output formats (markdown, structured data, screenshots, HTML) - Reliable extraction with retry mechanisms and error handling - Supports custom actions (click, scroll, input, wait) before data extraction - Geographic location customization for avoiding IP bans - Built-in rate limiting and request management As an example, we will build a simple scraper for [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). Specifically, we will scrape the “Yesterday’s Top Products” list from the homepage: The scraper extracts the following information from each product: Let’s get building: ```bash mkdir product-hunt-scraper cd product-hunt-scraper touch scraper.py .env python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install pydantic firecrawl-py echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your-api-key-here' >> .env\" ``` These commands set up a working directory for the scraper, along with a virtual environment and the main script. The last part also saves your Firecrawl API key, which you can get through their free plan by [signing up for an account](https://www.firecrawl.dev/). Let’s work on the code now: ```python import json from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp from dotenv import load_dotenv from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from datetime import datetime load_dotenv() ``` First, we import a few packages and the `FirecrawlApp` class - we use it to establish a connection with Firecrawl’s scraping engine. Then, we define a Pydantic class outlining the details we want to scrape from each product: ```python class Product(BaseModel): name: str = Field(description=\"The name of the product\") description: str = Field(description=\"A short description of the product\") url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the product\") topics: list[str] = Field( description=\"A list of topics the product belongs to. Can be found below the product description.\" ) n_upvotes: int = Field(description=\"The number of upvotes the product has\") n_comments: int = Field(description=\"The number of comments the product has\") rank: int = Field( description=\"The rank of the product on Product Hunt's Yesterday's Top Products section.\" ) logo_url: str = Field(description=\"The URL of the product's logo.\") ``` The field descriptions in this class play a crucial role in guiding the LLM scraping engine. By providing natural language descriptions for each field, we tell the LLM exactly what information to look for and where to find it on the page. For example, when we say “A list of topics under the product description”, the LLM understands both the content we want (topics) and its location (below the description). This natural language approach allows Firecrawl to intelligently parse the page’s HTML structure and extract the right information without requiring explicit CSS selectors or XPaths. The LLM analyzes the semantic meaning of our descriptions and matches them to the appropriate elements on the page. This approach offers two practical advantages: it reduces initial development time since you don’t need to manually inspect HTML structures, and it provides long-lasting resilience against HTML changes. Since the LLM understands the semantic meaning of the elements rather than relying on specific selectors, it can often continue working even when class names or IDs are updated. This makes it suitable for scenarios where long-term maintenance is a consideration. Getting back to code, we write another Pydantic class for scraping a collection of Products from the ‘Yesterday’s Top Products’ list: ```python class YesterdayTopProducts(BaseModel): products: list[Product] = Field( description=\"A list of top products from yesterday on Product Hunt.\" ) ``` The `YesterdayTopProducts` parent class is essential - without it, Firecrawl would only scrape a single product instead of the full list. This happens because Firecrawl strictly adheres to the provided schema structure, ensuring consistent and reliable output on every scraping run. Now, we define a function that scrapes ProductHunt based on the schema we just defined: ```python BASE_URL = \"https://www.producthunt.com\" def get_yesterday_top_products(): app = FirecrawlApp() data = app.scrape_url( BASE_URL, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": { \"schema\": YesterdayTopProducts.model_json_schema(), \"prompt\": \"Extract the top products listed under the 'Yesterday's Top Products' section. There will be exactly 5 products.\", }, }, ) return data[\"extract\"][\"products\"] ``` This function initializes a Firecrawl app, which reads your Firecrawl API key stored in an `.env` file and scrapes the URL. Notice the parameters being passed to the `scrape_url()` method: - `formats` specifies how the data should be scraped and extracted. Firecrawl supports other formats like markdown, HTML, screenshots or links. - `schema`: The JSON schema produced by the Pydantic class - `prompt`: A general prompt guiding the underlying LLM on what to do. Providing a prompt usually improves the performance. In the end, the function returns the extracted products, which will be a list of dictionaries. The final step is writing a function to save this data to a JSON file: ```python def save_yesterday_top_products(): products = get_yesterday_top_products() date_str = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y_%m_%d\") filename = f\"ph_top_products_{date_str}.json\" with open(filename, \"w\") as f: json.dump(products, f) if __name__ == \"__main__\": save_yesterday_top_products() ``` This function runs the previous one and saves the returned data to a JSON file identifiable with the following day’s date. * * * We’ve just built a scraper that resiliently extracts data from ProductHunt. To keep things simple, we implemented everything in a single script with straightforward data persistence. In production environments with larger data flows and more complex websites, your project would likely span multiple directories and files. Nevertheless, the deployment methods we’ll explore work for nearly any type of project. You can always restructure your own projects to follow this pattern of having a single entry point that coordinates all the intermediate scraping stages. ## Deploying Web Scrapers With GitHub Actions GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform built into GitHub that allows you to automate workflows, including running scrapers on a schedule. It provides a simple way to deploy and run automated tasks without managing infrastructure, making it an ideal choice for web scraping projects. To get started, initialize Git and commit the work we’ve completed so far in your working directory: ```python git init touch .gitignore echo \".env\" >> .gitignore # Remove the .env file from Git indexing git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" ``` Then, create an empty GitHub repository, copy its link and set it as the remote for your local repo: ```bash git remote add origin your-repo-link git push ``` ### Creating workflow files Workflow files are YAML configuration files that tell GitHub Actions how to automate tasks in your repository. For our web scraping project, these files will define when and how to run our scraper. These files live in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository and contain instructions for: - When to trigger the workflow (like on a schedule or when code is pushed) - What environment to use (Python version, dependencies to install) - The actual commands to run your scraper - What to do with the scraped data Each workflow file acts like a recipe that GitHub Actions follows to execute your scraper automatically. This automation is perfect for web scraping since we often want to collect data on a regular schedule without manual intervention. For our scraper, we need a single workflow file that executes the `scraper.py` file. Let’s set it up: ```bash mkdir -p .github/workflows touch .github/workflows/ph-scraper.yml ``` Open the newly-created file and paste the following contents: ```yml name: Product Hunt Scraper on: schedule: - cron: \"0 1 * * *\" # Runs at 1 AM UTC daily workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger permissions: contents: write jobs: scrape: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: persist-credentials: true - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: \"3.10\" - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install -r requirements.txt - name: Run scraper env: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} run: python scraper.py - name: Commit and push if changes run: | git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\" git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\" git add *.json git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m \"Update ProductHunt data [skip ci]\" git push ``` The YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow for automated web scraping: name: Specifies the workflow name that appears in GitHub Actions UI on: Defines how workflow triggers: - schedule: Uses cron syntax to run daily at 1 AM UTC - workflow\\_dispatch: Enables manual workflow triggering jobs: Contains the workflow jobs: - scrape: Main job that runs on ubuntu-latest - steps: Sequential actions to execute: 1. Checkout repository using `actions/checkout` 2. Setup Python 3.10 environment 3. Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt` 4. Run the scraper with environment variables 5. Commit and push any changes to the repository The workflow automatically handles repository interaction, dependency management, and data updates while providing both scheduled and manual execution options. You can read the [official GitHub guide on workflow file syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#about-yaml-syntax-for-workflows) to learn more. For this workflow file to sun successfully, we need to take a couple of additional steps. ### Generating a `requirements.txt` file One of the steps in the workflow file is installing the dependencies for our project using a `requirements.txt` file, which is a standard format for listing packages used in your project. For simple projects, you can create this file manually and adding each package on a new line like: ```text pydantic firecrawl-py ``` However, if you have a large project with multiple files and dozens of dependencies, you need an automated method. The simplest one I can suggest is using `pipreqs` package: ```bash pip install pipreqs pipreqs . ``` `pipreqs` is a lightweight package that scans all Python scripts in your project and adds them to a new `requirements.txt` file with their used versions. ### Storing secrets If you notice, the workflow file has a step that executes `scraper.py`: ```yml - name: Run scraper env: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }} run: python scraper.py ``` The workflow retrieves environment variables using the `secrets.SECRET_NAME` syntax. Since the `.env` file containing your Firecrawl API key isn’t uploaded to GitHub for security reasons, you’ll need to store the key in your GitHub repository secrets. To add your API key as a secret: 1. Navigate to your GitHub repository 2. Click on “Settings” 3. Select “Secrets and variables” then “Actions” 4. Click “New repository secret” 5. Enter “FIRECRAWL\\_API\\_KEY” as the name 6. Paste your API key as the value 7. Click “Add secret” This allows the workflow to securely access your API key during execution without exposing it in the repository. ### Running the workflow Before running the workflow, we need to commit all new changes and push them to GitHub: ```python git add . git commit -m \"Descriptive commit message\" ``` This makes our workflow visible to GitHub. At the top of the workflow file, we set a schedule for the workflow file to run at 1 AM using `cron` syntax: ```yaml on: schedule: - cron: \"0 1 * * *\" # Runs at 1 AM UTC daily workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger ``` The `cron` syntax consists of 5 fields representing minute (0-59), hour (0-23), day of month (1-31), month (1-12), and day of week (0-6, where 0 is Sunday). Each field can contain specific values, ranges (1-5), lists (1,3,5), or asterisks (\\_) meaning “every”. For example, `0 1 _ \\* \\*` means “at minute 0 of hour 1 (1 AM UTC) on every day of every month”. Here are some more patterns: - `0 */2 * * *`: Every 2 hours - `0 9-17 * * 1-5`: Every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays - `*/15 * * * *`: Every 15 minutes - `0 0 * * 0`: Every Sunday at midnight - `0 0 1 * *`: First day of every month at midnight - `30 18 * * 1,3,5`: Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 6:30 PM So, once the workflow file is pushed to GitHub, the scraper is scheduler to run. However, the `workflow_dispatch` parameter in the file allows us to run the scraper manually for debugging. Navigate to the Actions tab of your GitHub repository, click on the workflow name and press “Run workflow”. In about a minute (if the workflow is successful), you will see the top five products from yesterday on ProductHunt saved as a JSON file to your repository. Whenever you want to interrupt the scraping schedule, click on the three buttons in the top-right corner of the workflow page and disable it. ## Deploying Web Scrapers With Heroku [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying applications straightforward, even for beginners. While it removed its generous free tier in 2022, its basic $5 “dyno” plan still has some free features we can take advantage of for the purposes of this tutorial. ### Setting up Heroku First, install the Heroku CLI and login to your account: ```bash brew install heroku/brew/heroku # macOS curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh # Linux heroku login # Opens your web browser ``` Then, create a new Heroku app and set it as a remote for your repository: ```bash heroku create ph-scraper-your-name # Make the app name unique heroku git:remote -a ph-scraper-your-name ``` After this step, if you visit [dashboard.heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), your app must be visible. ### Configuring the Application Heroku requires a few additional files to run your application. First, create a `Procfile` that tells Heroku what command to run: ```bash touch Procfile echo \"worker: python scraper.py\" > Procfile ``` Next, create a `runtime.txt` to specify the Python version: ```bash touch runtime.txt echo \"python-3.10.12\" > runtime.txt ``` ### Environment Variables Instead of using a `.env` file, Heroku requires you to set your environment variables directly using the Heroku CLI: ```bash heroku config:set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your-api-key-here' ``` You can verify the variables are set correctly with: ```bash heroku config ``` ### Scheduling Scraper Runs Heroku uses an add-on called [“Scheduler”](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/scheduler) for running periodic tasks. Install it with: ```bash heroku addons:create scheduler:standard ``` Then open the scheduler dashboard: ```bash heroku addons:open scheduler ``` In the web interface, add a new job with the command `python scraper.py` and set your desired frequency (daily, hourly, or every 10 minutes). ### Deployment and Monitoring Now, to launch everything, you need to deploy your application by committing and pushing the local changes to Heroku: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add Heroku-related files\" git push heroku main ``` You can periodically monitor the health of your application with the following command: ```bash heroku logs --tail ``` ### Platform Limitations The basic $5 dyno has some important limitations to consider: - Sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity - Limited to 512MB RAM - Shares CPU with other applications - Maximum of 23 hours active time per day For most small to medium scraping projects, these limitations aren’t problematic. However, if you need more resources, you can upgrade to Standard (25/month)orPerformance(25/month) or Performance (25/month)orPerformance(250/month) dynos. ### Data Persistence Since Heroku’s filesystem is temporary, you’ll need to modify the scraper to store data externally. Here’s a quick example using AWS S3: ```python import boto3 # pip install boto3 from datetime import datetime def save_yesterday_top_products(): products = get_yesterday_top_products() # Initialize S3 client s3 = boto3.client('s3') # Create filename with date date_str = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y_%m_%d\") filename = f\"ph_top_products_{date_str}.json\" # Upload to S3 s3.put_object( Bucket='your-bucket-name', Key=filename, Body=json.dumps(products) ) ``` For this to work, you must already have an AWS account and an existing S3 bucket. Also, you must set your AWS credentials as Heroku secrets through the Heroku CLI: ```bash heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-key' heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret' ``` Once you do, add `boto3` to the list of dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file: ```bash echo \"boto3\" >> requirements.txt ``` Finally, commit and push the changes: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Switch data persistence to S3\" git push heroku main git push origin main ``` You can confirm that the app is functioning properly by setting the schedule frequency to 10 minutes and checking your S3 bucket for the JSON file containing the top five products from ProductHunt. ### Stopping Heroku Apps To stop your app, you can use a few different methods: - Pause the dyno: ```bash heroku ps:scale worker=0 ``` This stops the worker dyno without deleting the app. To resume later: ```bash heroku ps:scale worker=1 ``` - Disable the scheduler: ```bash heroku addons:destroy scheduler ``` Or visit the Heroku dashboard and remove the scheduler add-on manually. - Delete the entire app: ```bash heroku apps:destroy --app your-app-name --confirm your-app-name ``` ⚠️ Warning: This permanently deletes your app and all its data. - Maintenance mode ```bash heroku maintenance:on ``` This puts the app in maintenance mode. To disable: ```bash heroku maintenance:off ``` * * * To learn more about Heroku and how to run Python applications on its servers, please refer to [their Python support documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python-support). ## Deploying Web Scrapers With PythonAnywhere [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) is a cloud-based Python development environment that offers an excellent platform for hosting web scrapers. It provides a free tier that includes: - Daily scheduled tasks - Web-based console access - 512MB storage - Basic CPU and memory allocation ### Setting Up PythonAnywhere First, create a free account at [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). Once logged in, follow these steps: Open a Bash console from your PythonAnywhere dashboard and execute these commands to clone the GitHub repository we’ve been building: ```bash $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git $ cd your-repo $ python3 -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate $ pip install -r requirements.txt # Recreate your .env file $ touch .env $ echo \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\" >> .env ``` ### Scheduling the Scraper PA free tier includes a scheduler with a daily frequency. To enable it, follow these steps 1. Go to the “Tasks” tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard accessible via [https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/your-username](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/your-username) 2. Add a new scheduled task. 3. Set the timing using the provided interface. 4. Enter the command to run your scraper: ```bash cd /home/your-username/your-repo && source venv/bin/activate && python scraper.py ``` The command changes the working directory to the project location, activates the virtual environment and executes the scraper. ### Data Storage Options PythonAnywhere’s filesystem is persistent, unlike Heroku, so you can store JSON files directly. However, for better scalability, consider using cloud storage: ```python def save_yesterday_top_products(): \"\"\" Change back to JSON-based storage. \"\"\" products = get_yesterday_top_products() # Local storage (works on PythonAnywhere) date_str = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y_%m_%d\") filename = f\"data/ph_top_products_{date_str}.json\" # Create data directory if it doesn't exist os.makedirs(\"data\", exist_ok=True) with open(filename, \"w\") as f: json.dump(products, f) ``` ### Platform benefits & limitations PythonAnywhere offers several advantages for web scraping: - **Always-on environment**: Unlike Heroku’s free tier, PythonAnywhere doesn’t sleep - **Persistent storage**: Files remain stored between runs - **Simple interface**: User-friendly web console and file editor - **Built-in scheduler**: No need for additional add-ons - **Free SSL**: HTTPS requests work out of the box - **Multiple Python Versions**: Support for different Python versions The free tier has some restrictions: - Limited to 1 daily task - CPU/RAM throttling - 512MB storage limit ### Stopping or Modifying Tasks To manage your scraper: 1. **Pause**: Disable the scheduled task in the Tasks tab 2. **Modify schedule**: Edit timing in the Tasks interface 3. **Delete**: Remove the task completely 4. **Update code**: Pull latest changes from git repository from any PythonAnywhere bash console: ```bash cd your-repo git pull origin main ``` ## Best Practices and Optimization Our scraper and deployment methods are far from perfect. In this section, we will cover some best practices and tips to optimize its performance. ### Error Handling & Monitoring Proper error handling and monitoring are crucial for maintaining a reliable web scraper. Below, we will implement a few mechanisms. #### Implement a robust retry mechanism ```python from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential @retry( stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10), reraise=True ) def get_yesterday_top_products(): try: app = FirecrawlApp() data = app.scrape_url( BASE_URL, params={ \"formats\": [\"extract\"], \"extract\": { \"schema\": YesterdayTopProducts.model_json_schema(), \"prompt\": \"Extract the top products listed under the 'Yesterday's Top Products' section.\" }, }, ) return data[\"extract\"][\"products\"] except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Scraping failed: {str(e)}\") raise ``` Above, we are implementing a retry mechanism using the tenacity library. It will retry the scraping operation up to 3 times with exponential backoff between attempts. The wait time starts at 4 seconds and increases exponentially up to 10 seconds between retries. If all retries fail, it will raise the last exception. Any errors are logged before being re-raised to trigger the retry mechanism. #### Implement comprehensive logging ```python import logging from datetime import datetime def setup_logging(): \"\"\"Configure logging with both file and console handlers.\"\"\" logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Create formatters detailed_formatter = logging.Formatter( '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s' ) simple_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s: %(message)s') # File handler file_handler = logging.FileHandler( f'logs/scraper_{datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")}.log' ) file_handler.setFormatter(detailed_formatter) # Console handler console_handler = logging.StreamHandler() console_handler.setFormatter(simple_formatter) # Add handlers logger.addHandler(file_handler) logger.addHandler(console_handler) return logger logger = setup_logging() ``` The logging setup above configures comprehensive logging for our web scraper, which is essential for monitoring, debugging and maintaining the scraper in production. It creates two logging handlers - one that writes detailed logs to dated files (including timestamps and log levels), and another that outputs simplified logs to the console. This dual logging approach helps us track scraper execution both in real-time via console output and historically through log files. Having proper logging is crucial for diagnosing issues, monitoring performance, and ensuring the reliability of our web scraping system. #### Set up monitoring alerts ```python import requests def send_alert(message, webhook_url): \"\"\"Send alerts to Slack/Discord/etc.\"\"\" payload = {\"text\": message} try: requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload) except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Failed to send alert: {str(e)}\") def monitor_scraping_health(products): \"\"\"Monitor scraping health and send alerts if needed.\"\"\" if not products: send_alert( \"⚠️ Warning: No products scraped from ProductHunt\", os.getenv(\"WEBHOOK_URL\") ) return False if len(products) Optional[str]: \"\"\"Validate product data and return error message if invalid.\"\"\" required_fields = ['name', 'description', 'url', 'topics'] for field in required_fields: if not product.get(field): return f\"Missing required field: {field}\" if not isinstance(product.get('n_upvotes'), int): return \"Invalid upvote count\" if not product.get('url').startswith('http'): return \"Invalid URL format\" return None def validate_products(products: list) -> list: \"\"\"Validate and filter products.\"\"\" valid_products = [] for product in products: error = ProductValidator.validate_product(product) if error: logger.warning(f\"Invalid product data: {error}\") continue valid_products.append(product) return valid_products ``` A class like `ProductValidator` is important for ensuring data quality and consistency in our web scraping pipeline. It validates product data against required fields and format specifications before storage. This validation step helps prevent corrupted or incomplete data from entering our system, making downstream processing more reliable. The class provides static methods to validate individual products and entire product lists, checking for required fields like name and description, proper URL formatting, and valid upvote counts. #### Implement efficient storage ```python import json import gzip from pathlib import Path class DataManager: def __init__(self, base_dir: str = \"data\"): self.base_dir = Path(base_dir) self.base_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True) def save_products(self, products: list, compress: bool = True): \"\"\"Save products with optional compression.\"\"\" date_str = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y_%m_%d\") if compress: filename = self.base_dir / f\"ph_products_{date_str}.json.gz\" with gzip.open(filename, 'wt', encoding='utf-8') as f: json.dump(products, f) else: filename = self.base_dir / f\"ph_products_{date_str}.json\" with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: json.dump(products, f) def load_products(self, date_str: str) -> list: \"\"\"Load products for a specific date.\"\"\" gz_file = self.base_dir / f\"ph_products_{date_str}.json.gz\" json_file = self.base_dir / f\"ph_products_{date_str}.json\" if gz_file.exists(): with gzip.open(gz_file, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f: return json.load(f) elif json_file.exists(): with open(json_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: return json.load(f) return [] ``` The `DataManager` class extends our plain storage function from the previous sections. It provides a robust and organized way to handle data persistence for our web scraper. The class implements both compressed and uncompressed storage options using `gzip`, which helps optimize disk space usage while maintaining data accessibility. By organizing data by date and providing consistent file naming conventions, it enables easy tracking and retrieval of historical product data. ## Conclusion And that’s a wrap! We’ve covered several ways to deploy web scrapers in 2025, from simple GitHub Actions to more complex setups with Heroku and PythonAnywhere. Each method has its own sweet spot: - GitHub Actions: Great for simple scrapers that run daily/weekly - Heroku: Perfect for more frequent scraping with its flexible scheduler - PythonAnywhere: Solid choice for beginners with its user-friendly interface Remember, start small and scale up as needed. No need to jump straight into complex setups if GitHub Actions does the job. The best deployment method is the one that matches your specific needs and technical comfort level. 🕷️ Here are some related resources that might interest you: - [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) - [Firecrawl documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/) - [Comprehensive guide on Firecrawl’s `scrape_url` method](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/mastering-firecrawl-scrape-endpoint) - [How to generate sitemaps in Python using Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/how-to-generate-sitemaps-using-firecrawl-map-endpoint) Thank you for reading!
